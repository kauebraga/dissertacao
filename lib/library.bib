abstract = {While transit agencies have increasingly adopted systems for collecting data on passengers and vehicles, the ability to derive high-resolution passenger trajectories and directly associate them with transit vehicles in a general and transferable manner remains a challenge. In this paper, a system of integrated methods is presented to reconstruct and track travelers usage of transit at a detailed level by matching location data from smartphones to automatic transit vehicle location (AVL) data and by identifying all out-of-vehicle and in-vehicle portions of the passengers trips. High-resolution travel times and their relationships with the timetable are then derived. Approaches are presented for processing relatively sparse smartphone location data in dense transit networks with many overlapping bus routes, distinguishing waits and transfers from non-travel related activities, and tracking underground travel in a Metro network. The derived information enables a range of analyses and applications, including the development of user-centric performance measures. Results are presented from an implementation and deployment of the system on San Francisco's Muni network. Based on 103 ground-truth passenger trips, the detection accuracy is found to be approximately 93{\%}. A set of example applications and findings presented in this paper underscore the value of the previously unattainable high-resolution traveler-vehicle coupled movements on a large-scale basis.},

abstract = {In this work, we present methods to estimate average daily origin-destination trips from triangulated mobile phone records of millions of anonymized users. These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user's origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user's home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals' daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.},

abstract = {Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a ‘big' data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population's activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city's master plan.To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban transformations.},

abstract = {Smart card data are increasingly used for transit network planning, passengers' behaviour analysis and network demand forecasting. Public transport origin-destination (O-D) estimation is a significant product of processing smart card data. In recent years, various O-D estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, the validity of these estimation methods has not been extensively investigated. This is mainly because these datasets usually lack data about passengers' alighting, as passengers are often required to tap their smart cards only when boarding a public transport service. Thus, this paper has two main objectives. First, the paper reports on the implementation and validation of the existing O-D estimation method using the unique smart card dataset of the South-East Queensland public transport network which includes data on both boarding stops and alighting stops. Second, the paper improves the O-D estimation algorithm and empirically examines these improvements, relying on this unique dataset. The evaluation of the last destination assumption of the trip-chaining method shows a significant negative impact on the matching results of the differences between actual boarding/alighting times and the public transport schedules. The proposed changes to the algorithm improve the average distance between the actual and estimated alighting stops, as this distance is reduced from 806 m using the original algorithm to 530 m after applying the suggested improvements.},

abstract = {Understanding travel behaviour is significant in travel demand management as well as in urban and transport planning. Over the past decade, with the advancement of data collection techniques, such as GPS, transit smart cards, and mobile phones, various types of travel trajectory data are increasingly complementing or replacing conventional travel diaries and stated preference data. Other location-aware data are used in studying human movement patterns, such as social network check-in data and banknote dispersal data. Abundance of the emerging trajectory data has driven a new wave of travel behaviour research, and introduced new research problems. This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of the travel behaviour studies categorised by trajectory data types. Based on the literature review, research challenges are discussed and promising research topics in this field are proposed for future studies.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a robust dynamic control mechanism for bus transit system, taking account of variations in congestion delays and passenger demand, and combines bus holding and operating speed control strategies. By using a prespecified uncertainty set, we propose a state space model for bus motion with delay disturbances and passenger demand uncertainties. According to the Lyapunov function analysis method, we design a robust dynamic control based on the state-feedback scheme as the bus control to achieve the robust stability of the bus transit system, which effectively reduces the bus bunching phenomenon. Furthermore, we formulate a nonlinear optimal control problem to design the robust optimal bus control, which not only reduces the bus bunching, but also improves the schedule adherence and headway regularity of bus service lines. To handle the complexity of the nonlinear optimal control problem with uncertain parameters and disturbances, we reduce it to a convex optimization problem by the minimization of an upper bound on the objective function. The problem is solved in a polynomial time and satisfies the practical real time requirement. Numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the model and control methods.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to estimate both the physical and schedule-based connections of metro passengers from their entry and exit times at the gates and the stations, a data set available from Smart Card transactions in a majority of train networks. By examining the Smart Card data, we will observe a set of transit behaviors of metro passengers, which is manifested by the time intervals that identifies the boarding, transferring, or alighting train at a station. The authenticity of the time intervals is ensured by separating a set of passengers whose trip has a unique connection that is predominantly better by all respects than any alternative connection. Since the connections of such passengers, known as reference passengers, can be readily determined and hence their gate times and stations can be used to derive reliable time intervals. To detect an unknown path of a passenger, the proposed method checks, for each alternative connection, if it admits a sequence of boarding, middle train(s), and alighting trains, whose time intervals are all consistent with the gate times and stations of the passenger, a necessary condition of a true connection. Tested on weekly 32 million trips, the proposed method detected unique connections satisfying the necessary condition, which are, therefore, most likely true physical and schedule-based connections in 92.6 and 83.4 {\%}, respectively, of the cases.},

abstract = {Smart card automated fare collection systems have been effective for the collection of data about the travel behavior of users on public transit networks. Because some systems record only the boarding (origin) locations, a method is needed for estimating the alighting (destination) locations. Existing algorithms can estimate the destination for most trips. However, unlinked trips, which are not part of a trip chain during the day, are more difficult to analyze. The proposed improvement to the existing model for destination estimation, especially for unlinked trips, is based on kernel density estimation of the spatial and temporal probabilities of each destination. The Societe de Transport de l'Outaouais, a medium-sized bus service near Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, provided data for a 1-month period in 2009 (908,303 total transactions). Existing algorithms can handle only 80.64{\%} of the trips; the proposed method handles an additional 10.9{\%}. These results are analyzed, and future research directions are discussed.},

Many other cities in the world have experienced the same, and sooner or later, this is likely to happen everywhere. Seeing this opportunity, many researchers have developed tools to obtain valuable information from the available data. However, the case of Transantiago is particularly advantageous because all buses have GPS devices and the smart card presents an overall 97{\%} penetration rate. We describe a successful experience of collaboration between academia and the public transport authority to develop tools based on passive data processing. We include a brief description of the Transantiago system and the agreements made to develop the aforementioned tools. We also describe the methods developed to obtain valuable information like public transport trips origin-destination matrices, speed profiles of buses and service quality indicators, among others. Several examples of specific uses of the information for public transport policy and planning in Santiago are presented. The paper concludes with a discussion of what else can be obtained from this data and why we believe that this can change the way we do transport planning.},

Cluster analysis is then used to analyze the geographic distribution of the associated improvements. The results show that bike-and-ride has the potential to substantially increase job accessibility in the different areas of the city, but does not result in a more equal spatial distribution of job accessibility, as measured by Gini coefficients. Most of the improvements are centered in middle to high income areas with good accessibility. Peripheral areas, that tend to be the poorest and have the lowest accessibility by transit, improve the least. The inclusion of the bicycle is not enough to counteract all of the other forces causing low job accessibility in these areas.},

This paper presents a methodology for identifying bus stops that are not meeting performance standards for schedule adherence and the factors that cause inadequate performance.

However, the existingmarket segmentation studies in the literature have been generally done using passenger surveys, which have various limitations. The smart card (SC) data from an automated fare collection system facilitate the understanding of the multiday travel pattern of transit passengers and can be used to segment them into identifiable types of similar behaviors and needs. This paper proposes a comprehensive methodology for passenger segmentation solely using SC data. After recon- structing the travel itineraries from SC transactions, this paper adopts the density-based spatial clustering of application with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to mine the travel pattern of each SC user. An apriori market segmentation approach then segments transit passengers into four identifiable types. The methodology proposed in this paper assists transit operators to understand their passengers and provides them oriented information and services.},

abstract = {The “left-behind” phenomenon occurs frequently in Urban Rail Transit (URT) networks with booming travel demand, especially during peak hours in a complex URT network, which makes passenger travel patterns more complicated. This paper proposes a methodology to mine passenger travel patterns based on fare transaction records from automatic fare collection (AFC) systems and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data from Communication Based Train Control (CBTC) Systems or tracking systems. By introducing the concept of a sequence, a space-time-sequence trajectory model is proposed to simulate a passenger's travel activities, including when they are left-behind. The paper analyzes passenger travel trajectory links and estimates the weight of each feasible trajectory under tap-in/tap-out constraints. The station time parameters, including access/egress and transfer walking-time parameters, are important inputs for the model. The paper also presents a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate these parameters from AFC transaction data and AVL data. The methodology is applied to a case study using AFC and AVL data from the Beijing URT network during peak hours to test the proposed model and algorithm. The estimation results are consistent with the results obtained from the authorities, and this finding verifies the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Understanding travellers' behaviour is key element in transportation planning. This article presents a route choice model for metro networks that considers different time components as well as variables related to the transferring experience, train crowding, network topology and socio-demographic characteristics. The route choice model is applied to the London Underground and Santiago Metro networks, to make a comparison of the decision making process of the users on both cities. As all the variables are statistically significant, it is possible to affirm that public transport users take into account a wide variety of elements when choosing routes. While in London the travellers prefer to spend time walking, in Santiago is preferable to spend time waiting. Santiago Metro users are more willing to travel in crowded trains than London Underground users. Both user groups have a similar dispreference to transfers after controlling for the time spent on transfer, but different attitudes to ascending and descending transfers. Topological factors presented on a distorted Metro map are more important than actual topology to passengers' route choice decisions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The availability of large amounts of mobility data has stimulated the research in discovering patterns and understanding regularities. Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.},

abstract = {To more effectively expand transit service coverage through promoting bicycling, a practical approach is presented in the paper for estimating the coverage of transit service accessible by non-motorized modes (i.e. walking and bicycling). The non-motorized accessibility to transit is determined by the connectivity and facilities of non-motorized network. Using the data from 2009 to 2010 GPS-based Household Travel Survey in the Cincinnati metropolitan area, the study examines distance thresholds of such non-motorized transit access trips and identifies the spatial boundary and geographic area of transit catchment areas in the Geographic Information System environment. Results suggest that bicycle enables people to access the transit service. The bicycle-transit catchment area is estimated as 1.7 and 2.3 times of the size of pedestrian-transit catchment area at home and activity ends respectively. As a result, more households and employment can reach the transit service via bicycling than walking (52.45{\%} vs. 36.72{\%} for households and 47.82{\%}. vs. 33.07{\%} for employment in the study area). Suburbs, where near half of population and employment situate, are comparatively underserved. Especially, only 27.14{\%} {\%} of the disadvantaged population in suburbs, can access transit by walking, but the percent is increased to 50.96{\%} if using a bicycle. Besides the distance threshold, the non-motorized accessibility to transit is found to be a significant factor determining transit catchment areas. The transit service area can be expanded if a safer and more comfortable bicycling environment is available. Those findings can also be further used as references in the transit-oriented development planning.},

In order to deal with the endogeneity problem, we employ instrumental variables with a generalised spatial two-stage least square (GS2SLS) model with fixed-effects. Our findings suggest that job accessibility plays a significant role in explaining unemployment rates and household income. Consistent with Kain's spatial mismatch hypothesis, increases in job accessibility for African Americans lead to decreases in unemployment.

abstract = {Trips need to be described and have always been characterized by various levels of abstraction. It varies from a simple label such as home-based work to complete itinerary with sociodemographic characteristics of the trip maker and household. The rationale behind such classifications is that planners and modelers recognize that the demand of transportation is highly differentiated. It is hoped that additional attributes would provide a more complete portrait of the demand and an improved understanding of the underlying travel behavior. Passive data collection technologies bring an extra dimension to travel data acquisition. Multiday data, which are difficult to collect, become accessible. In public transit, a smart card automatic fare collection system with automatic vehicle location capability provides high-resolution longitudinal data on travel pattern but also suffers from the inherent limitations of passive methods. This paper proposes a methodology to enhance transit trip characterization by adding a multiday dimension to a month of smart card transactions. On the basis of an individual, anchor points—precise to an exact address—are detected. Boarding and alighting locations are described with respect to those anchors. The enhancement allows in-depth travel behavior analysis on a subgroup sharing a common anchor or an individual. The paper demonstrates the use of spatial statistics, spatial analyses with geographic information system, visualizations, and data mining to describe activity space and locations and departure time dynamics, and to derive monthly trip table, activity schedule, and behavioral rules for cardholders. The results offer promising insights to transit planning and the understanding of travel behavior.},

These measures fail to take into account (i) the ability of individuals to adjust their activity–travel patterns in coping with constrained choice sets, (ii) uncertainty in the perception of travel times, (iii) temporal variability of travel times, and (iv) the influence of travel information on accessibility. The aim of the present article is to contribute to this literature by addressing these four shortcomings. Theory will be developed and illustrated using numerical simulations. The results suggest that the accessibility measure proposed in this article is a useful indicator of social inclusion in terms of the time individuals can spend to conduct their preferred activities. Moreover, accessibility is found to be affected by the presence of schedule delay penalties, restrictions in time allocation to activities, and the provision of travel time information in order to reduce uncertainty.},

abstract = {Urban spatial structure in large cities is becoming ever more complex as populations grow in size, engage in more travel, and have increasing amounts of disposable income that enable them to live more diverse lifestyles. These trends have prominent and visible effects on urban activity, and cities are becoming more polycentric in their structure as new clusters and hotspots emerge and coalesce in a wider sea of urban development. Here, we apply recent methods in network science and their generalization to spatial analysis to identify the spatial structure of city hubs, centers, and borders, which are essential elements in understanding urban interactions. We use a ‘big' data set for Singapore from the automatic smart card fare collection system, which is available for sample periods in 2010, 2011, and 2012 to show how the changing roles and influences of local areas in the overall spatial structure of urban movement can be efficiently monitored from daily transportation.In essence, we first construct a weighted directed graph from these travel records. Each node in the graph denotes an urban area, edges denote the possibility of travel between any two areas, and the weight of edges denotes the volume of travel, which is the number of trips made. We then make use of (a) the graph properties to obtain an overall view of travel demand, (b) graph centralities for detecting urban centers and hubs, and (c) graph community structures for uncovering socioeconomic clusters defined as neighborhoods and their borders. Finally, results of this network analysis are projected back onto geographical space to reveal the spatial structure of urban movements. The revealed community structure shows a clear subdivision into different areas that separate the population's activity space into smaller neighborhoods. The generated borders are different from existing administrative ones. By comparing the results from 3 years of data, we find that Singapore, even from such a short time series, is developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form, where new subcenters and communities are emerging largely in line with the city's master plan.To summarize, our approach yields important insights into urban phenomena generated by human movements. It represents a quantitative approach to urban analysis, which explicitly identifies ongoing urban transformations.},

abstract = {Food desert studies attempt to identify geographic areas in which people lack access to sources of healthy food. While academic and policy research often defines access to food stores using simple Euclidean distance or road network metrics, dense urban areas with large public transit systems call for more sophisticated methods of determining access. It is particularly important to understand the level of access the transit-dependent population has to healthy food vendors, as their mobility is largely constrained by the routes and scheduling of their local public transportation system. In this study, we analyze public transit access to supermarkets in Cincinnati, Ohio. Using General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data from the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) and the Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky (TANK) and custom ArcGIS tools, we calculate the time it takes to travel from each Cincinnati census block to its nearest supermarkets at different times of the day. This transit-travel-time matrix allows us to investigate food deserts that change shape based on the time of day considered and to calculate the temporal variability in block-level access. Also, by combining this time-dependent analysis with census data on race, income, and age, we search for disparities in average levels of accessibility. The results of this analysis identify the areas and subpopulations in Cincinnati with the greatest need for improved access to healthy food stores and will demonstrate how schedule-dependent transportation can be factored into measures of accessibility. Ultimately, this study paints a more complete and realistic picture of food deserts in Cincinnati and helps policy-makers better target interventions aimed at mitigating their effects. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

However, although access to public transit is often seen as benefiting low-income groups, in some cities community groups have challenged TOD plans on the grounds that they could cause gentrification and displacement. Yet, empirical studies have found little evidence that gentrification actually causes displacement. This article examines the connection between TOD and displacement in urban areas and seeks to make sense of the apparent discrepancy between community opposition to TOD and the empirical findings on displacement. Four explanations are considered: methodological shortcomings in existing studies, insufficient attention to social and psychological forms of displacement, potential transportation cost savings, and use of TOD plans as a policy target. The fourth explanation is illustrated using an example from the San Francisco Bay Area of California. This article aims to synthesize literature on these previously separate topics and to illuminate paths for future research.},

abstract = {The notion of socioeconomic status (SES) of a person or family reflects the corresponding entity's social and economic rank in society. Such information may help applications like bank loaning decisions and provide measurable inputs for related studies like social stratification, social welfare and business planning. Traditionally, estimating SES for a large population is performed by national statistical institutes through a large number of household interviews, which is highly expensive and time-consuming. Recently researchers try to estimate SES from data sources like mobile phone call records and online social network platforms, which is much cheaper and faster. Instead of relying on these data about users' cyberspace behaviors, various alternative data sources on real-world users' behavior such as mobility may offer new insights for SES estimation. In this paper, we leverage Smart Card Data (SCD) for public transport systems which records the temporal and spatial mobility behavior of a large population of users. More specifically, we develop S2S, a deep learning based approach for estimating people's SES based on their SCD. Essentially, S2S models two types of SES-related features, namely the temporal-sequential feature and general statistical feature, and leverages deep learning for SES estimation. We evaluate our approach in an actual dataset, Shanghai SCD, which involves millions of users. The proposed model clearly outperforms several state-of-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

Our (feeling of) connectedness also matters for the efficacy and functioning of communities and societies as a whole. Different mobility practices offer different conditions for being exposed to other people and the environment. Such exposure influences a sense of being connected to places, communities and societies. In transport planning practice and research, these relations are slowly getting attention. In this paper, we develop an analytical framework that offers a comprehensive understanding on if and how one's experiences of being on the move influence the ability of an individual to develop a sense of connectedness. We develop hypotheses about these possible relations, that link literatures from mobilities research and sociology to advance transport planning research and practice. First, we discuss how the experiences of being mobile using different transport modes set different stages for the potential exposure to a diversity of socio-spatial environments. Second, we translate this into an analytical framework for understanding the relationships between connectedness and using different mobility modes. In the final part of the paper, we illustrate this by operationalising a number of potential indicators of connectedness (as dependent variables).},

abstract = {In recent years, several transit agencies have been trying to be more competitive with the automobile to attract choice riders. Transit agencies can only be competitive if they can provide services that are reliable, have a short access and egress time, and have run times that are comparable to automobiles. Several transit agencies try to be competitive through offering faster service, such as limited-stop (express) bus service. This study uses AVL and APC data, in addition to a disaggregate data obtained from a travel behavior survey, to select stops and estimate run times for a new limited-stop service that will run parallel to a heavily used bus route (67 Saint-Michel) in Montr{\'{e}}al, Canada. Three different scenarios are developed based on theory and practice to select stops to be incorporated in the new limited service. The time savings for each scenario are then evaluated as a range and a fourth scenario is developed. A limited-stop service is recommended based on selecting stops serving both directions of the route, major activity points and stop spacing. This study shows that implementing a limited-stop service would yield substantial time savings for both, the new limited service and the existing regular service running in parallel. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The microsimulation of traffic is incorporating models to represent pedestrians and their interactions with vehicles. The pe- destrian crossing simulation is typically based on gap acceptance models, whose parameters should be calibrated for each specific situation. This paper presents a data collection methodology developed to acquire values of front and rear gaps with the objective of calibrating a pedestrian crossing model coded in the VISSIM software. This method allows the analysis of important particularities of the pedestrian crossing process, as for instance, pedestrians crossing at unsignalized areas, or starting to cross before vehicles leave the traffic lane. The data collection process is based on the analysis of images, which are transformed and used to track the pedestrians and vehicles. As analysis of the conflict between vehicle and pedestrians' routes result on the gap values for the model calibration process. This methodology is applicable to other data collection processes that require traffic conflicts analysis.},

abstract = {Improvements in accessibility are increasingly suggested as strategies leading to a reduction in vehicular travel, congestion, pollution and their related impacts. This approach assumes that individuals, if offered an opportunity, are likely to reduce their travel. It also assumes that accessibility-enhancing land-use changes will increase transit and non-motorized trips in lieu of automobile usage. However, there are numerous indications that people engage in excess travel and are not necessarily inclined to reduce it. This paper presents a number of hypotheses on the reasons for excess travel and the relationships among attitudes toward travel and responses to accessibility-enhancing strategies. It suggests that different market segments are likely to response to policy measures in different ways. In particular, if a large segment of the population prefers mobility over the reduced travel offered by accessibility improvements, then such policies will be less effective than anticipated.},

Bus transport networks (BTNs) are typical spatially embedded networks, but their spatial characteristics are commonly disregarded in previous researches. In this paper, we propose a new spatial representation model for BTNs with information on the geographical location of bus stations and routes, for which we named as the ES model. The new model aids in the study of real-world BTNs. By performing a statistical study with the new representation model on three typical BTNs in China, namely the Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou BTNs, we identify some network features that are consistent with those revealed by previous studies, as well as some new features such as high clustering of short-distance station pairs (SSPs) and small average number of bus routes in a path. The result shows that the existence of SSPs can significantly influence the characteristics of BTNs. Besides, with the help of the ES model, we designed a new transfer algorithm for BTNs.},

abstract = {There were 30.7 million registered cars in Great Britain in 2011, outnumbering the total number of households recorded by the census. Despite this, the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency's (DVLA) database of car model registrations remains underexplored as an indicator of socio-economic characteristics. In the past, car ownership itself has been frequently considered as a census proxy variable for affluence. However, this is an increasingly dated interpretation as ownership has become more widespread across society and the value of cars varies considerably. Understanding the geography of different car types, however, is likely to be more informative of local population characteristics as the choice of model is dependent on several factors, notably including the cost and the purpose of the vehicle. In partnership with the Department for Transport (DfT), a car segmentation was produced that grouped every car model registered in England and Wales in 2011 into 10 distinctive categories based on the vehicle's key characteristics. Data representing the total number of registered cars for each car segment and three age groups were made available at a small area geography (known as lower layer super output areas – LSOAs) to be analysed for this study. It revealed that each car segment is uniquely distributed across London, and the rest of England and Wales. The patterns were then compared with key 2011 Census variables on socio-economics to understand the extent to which spatial patterns of broad car characteristics correspond with variances in indicators of social make-up.},

Identifying mismatches between urban transit resources and regular transit users benefits the transportation resource allocation policy. This study introduces a location maximum likelihood estimation method and a cell space collector mechanism to explore distribution differences of regular transit riders and transit stations based on data mining. In Beijing, 5.37 million regular transit users were identified, and their first-morning transit stations were found to be within 2 km from their last transit stations used the day before. As their locations were estimated, differences in ratios of the regular transit riders to residents were found among areas. Most regular transit users were located in the suburban areas of 5–20 km from the center of Beijing, and the spatial distribution of transit stations declined from the center to the peripheral urban areas. This mismatch between public transit services and regular transit riders sheds light on urban transportation policies.},

Although ticket gates and bus fareboxes yield counts of passenger activity in specific stations or vehicles, the relationships between these transactions—the origins, transfers, and destinations of individual passengers—typically have been acquired only through small, costly, and infrequent rider surveys. New methods for inferring the journeys of all riders on a large public transit network have been built on recent work into the use of automated fare collection and vehicle location systems for analysis of passenger behavior. Complete daily sets of data from London's Oyster farecard and the iBus vehicle location system were used to infer boarding and alighting times and locations for individual bus passengers and to infer transfers between passenger trips of various public modes, and origin-destination matrices of linked intermodal transit journeys that include the estimated flows of passengers not using farecards were constructed. The outputs were validated against surveys and traditional origin-destination matrices. The software implementation demonstrated that the procedure is efficient enough to be performed daily, allowing transit providers to observe travel behavior on all services at all times.},

The Seoul metropolitan area is equipped with a system wherein a passenger's entire trajectory can be tracked. Despite this great advantage, the use of smart-card data has a critical limitation wherein the purpose behind a trip is unknown. The present study proposed a rigorous methodology to impute the sequence of activities for each trip chain using a continuous hidden Markov model (CHMM), which belongs to the category of unsupervised machine-learning technologies. Coupled with the spatial and temporal information on trip chains from smart-card data, land-use characteristics were used to train a CHMM. Unlike supervised models that have been mobilized to impute the trip purpose to GPS data, A CHMM does not require an extra survey, such as the prompted-recall survey, in order to obtain labeled data for training. The estimated result of the proposed model yielded plausible activity patterns that are intuitively accountable and consistent with observed activity patterns.},

abstract = {Bus arrival time is usually estimated using the boarding time of the first passenger at each station. However, boarding time data are not recorded in certain double-ticket smart card systems. As many passengers usually swipe the card much before their alighting, the first or the average alighting time cannot represent the actual bus arrival time, either. This lack of data creates difficulties in correcting bus arrival times. This paper focused on developing a model to calculate bus arrival time that combined the alighting swiping time from smart card data with the actual bus arrival time by the manual survey data. The model was built on the basis of the frequency distribution and the regression analysis. The swiping time distribution, the occupancy and the seating capacity were considered as the key factors in creating a method to calculate bus arrival times. With 1011 groups of smart card data and 360 corresponding records from a manual survey of bus arrival times, the research data were divided into two parts stochastically, a training set and a test set. The training set was used for the parameter determination, and the test set was used to verify the model's precision. Furthermore, the regularity of the time differences between the bus arrival times and the card swiping times was analyzed using the “trend line” of the last swiping time distribution. Results from the test set achieved mean and standard error rate deviations of 0.6{\%} and 3.8{\%}, respectively. The proposed model established in this study can improve bus arrival time calculations and potentially support state prediction and service level evaluations for bus operations.},

We explore data obtained from the Tel Aviv bike-sharing system and corresponding GTFS data, to understand the spatial patterns of cycling in the city and its relation to bus travel. Using a combination of transportation and geostatistical models including spatially adjusted regression, and all-or-nothing traffic assignment, we show that cycling movements are not well balanced and different behaviors are associated with the length of trips. Shorter trips are more concentrated in the city center and seem to complement bus travel. Longer trips are more focused on links with dedicated bicycle lanes and do not show strong correlations with bus travel, possibly indicating a weak substitution effect. The implications of data-driven studies for transport policy and spatial inquiries of urban mobility are further discussed.},

abstract = {The advent of Big Data era has transformed the outlook of numerous fields in science and engineering. The transportation arena also has great expectations of taking the advantage of Big Data enabled by the popularization of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). In this study, the viability of a proactive real-time traffic monitoring strategy evaluating operation and safety simultaneously was explored. The objective is to improve the system performance of urban expressways by reducing congestion and crash risk. In particular, Microwave Vehicle Detection System (MVDS) deployed on an expressway network in Orlando was utilized to achieve the objectives. The system consisting of 275 detectors covers 75 miles of the expressway network, with average spacing less than 1 mile. Comprehensive traffic flow parameters per lane are continuously archived on one-minute interval basis. The scale of the network, dense deployment of detection system, richness of information and continuous collection turn MVDS as the ideal source of Big Data. It was found that congestion on urban expressways was highly localized and time-specific. As expected, the morning and evening peak hours were the most congested time periods. The results of congestion evaluation encouraged real-time safety analysis to unveil the effects of traffic dynamics on crash occurrence. Data mining (random forest) and Bayesian inference techniques were implemented in real-time crash prediction models. The identified effects, both indirect (peak hour, higher volume and lower speed upstream of crash locations) and direct (higher congestion index downstream to crash locations) congestion indicators confirmed the significant impact of congestion on rear-end crash likelihood. As a response, reliability analysis was introduced to determine the appropriate time to trigger safety warnings according to the congestion intensity. Findings of this paper demonstrate the importance to jointly monitor and improve traffic operation and safety. The Big Data generated by the ITS systems is worth further exploration to bring all their full potential for more proactive traffic management.},

abstract = {In this work, we present methods to estimate average daily origin-destination trips from triangulated mobile phone records of millions of anonymized users. These records are first converted into clustered locations at which users engage in activities for an observed duration. These locations are inferred to be home, work, or other depending on observation frequency, day of week, and time of day, and represent a user's origins and destinations. Since the arrival time and duration at these locations reflect the observed (based on phone usage) rather than true arrival time and duration of a user, we probabilistically infer departure time using survey data on trips in major US cities. Trips are then constructed for each user between two consecutive observations in a day. These trips are multiplied by expansion factors based on the population of a user's home Census Tract and divided by the number of days on which we observed the user, distilling average daily trips. Aggregating individuals' daily trips by Census Tract pair, hour of the day, and trip purpose results in trip matrices that form the basis for much of the analysis and modeling that inform transportation planning and investments. The applicability of the proposed methodology is supported by validation against the temporal and spatial distributions of trips reported in local and national surveys.},

abstract = {Interpolation of motion data is a challenging problem that is often overlooked by researchers when using GPS data with low sampling rate. In this paper we define a spatio-temporal query called Historical Spatio-Temporal Query (HSTQ). This query receives a time and returns a waypoint containing spatio-temporal data of a moving object at that particular time. To respond to the query for any given time (e.g. every second), we need to interpolate missing waypoints of the trajectory. Linear Interpolation (LI) is the most commonly used method although it can be grossly inaccurate. To deal with this problem, we propose a method called Map-Based Interpolation (MBI). This method uses routing web-services to find significant points (path) between two waypoints. Instead of using road networks, which is typically used by methods such as map-matching, we send a query to a routing web service and analyse the returned data to find missing waypoints. To be able to respond to queries sent to HSTQ for any input time within a trajectory period, we use a combination of MBI and LI (MBI+LI) to interpolate the missing data. We also propose two measures for comparing performance of our interpolation method with LI. Experimental results using realistic trajectories show significant improvement in quality and accuracy of interpolated and down-sampled trajectory data using HSTQ with MBI+LI in comparison to the earlier, widely used LI method. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Understanding urban public ridership is essential for promoting public transportation. However, limited efforts have been made to reveal the spatial variations of multi-modal public ridership (such as buses, metro systems, and taxis) and the underlying controlling factors. This study explores multi-modal public ridership and compares the similarities and differences of the associated factors. Daily bus, metro, and taxi ridership patterns are first extracted from multiple sources of big transportation data, including vehicle (bus and taxi) GPS trajectories and smart card data. Multivariate regression analysis and geographically weighted regression analysis are used to reveal the associations between these data and demographic, land use, and transportation factors. An empirical study in Shenzhen, China, suggests that employment, mixed land use, and road density have significant effects on the ridership of each mode; however, some effects vary from negative to positive across the city. The results also indicate that road density, income, and metro accessibility do not have significant effects on metro, transit or bus ridership. These findings suggest that the effects of the associated factors vary depending on the mode of travel being considered and that the city should carefully consider which factors to emphasize in formulating future transport policy.},

abstract = {In the absence of other alternatives, people who rely on public transportation to conduct their daily activities have travel patterns that differ from discretionary transit users, especially those who choose to use transit for work trips. At the same time, in many regions around the world, public transportation is primarily designed to accommodate peak-hour travel demands in order to reduce congestion and its impacts. It is theorized that this results in a mismatch between the demand and supply of public transportation among populations at risk of social exclusion. In this research, we characterize and compare the spatiotemporal patterns of travel demand and transit supply. Our analysis consists of a comparison between observed travel patterns and a new temporal measure of transit supply based on travel times. We measure travel demand with the observed trip-making characteristics (i.e. origin, destination, time-of-day) of the respondents to two transportation surveys conducted in Utah. Transit supply is characterized using a transit travel time cube, a three-dimensional array of origin-destination transit travel times computed for all origins, destinations and times of day. Mismatch is examined by descriptive and multivariate comparisons of observed trips and computed levels of transit provision. Our results confirm theory: more marginalized groups demand travel between locations at times of the day that are poorly served by transit. However, when controlling for all variables simultaneously in a multivariate regression, few socioeconomic factors remain significant, indicating the overall importance of employment status, making work trips, and traveling during peak times, in explaining mismatch.},

Currently, the use of these tools is focused only on the final stage of planning, in the evaluation of alternatives, but they can also be applied in its more strategic stages of understanding problems. Seven LUTI models, representatives of the categories of spatial interaction, econometric and microsimulation models, were assessed for their ability to represent the inner and interrelations of the transport, land use and activity sub-systems, considering their level of aggregation, randomness and dynamics of the modeled decisions. It was found that these models' conceptual bases need to be explicitly laid to make it clear to actors, planners, and modelers their assumptions and limitations, turning not only their results, but also their construction process, especially the calibration and validation efforts, useful for a better understanding of the complex urban problems.},

The literature has been evolving from simple to more sophisticated methods such as from aggregated to individual travel pattern analysis, and from stop-to-stop to flexible stop aggregation. However, the issue of high computing complexity has limited these methods in practical applications. This paper proposes a new algorithm named Weighted Stop Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise (WS-DBSCAN) based on the classical Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm to detect and update the daily changes in travel pattern. WS-DBSCAN converts the classical quadratic computation complexity DBSCAN to a problem of sub-quadratic complexity. The numerical experiment using the real AFC data in South East Queensland, Australia shows that the algorithm costs only 0.45{\%} in computation time compared to the classical DBSCAN, but provides the same clustering results.},

abstract = {In this paper we assess the accuracy with which General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) schedule data can be used to measure accessibility by public transit as it varies over space and time. We use archived Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data from four North American transit agencies to produce a detailed reconstruction of actual transit vehicle movements over the course of five days in a format that allows for travel time estimation directly comparable to schedule-based GTFS. With travel times estimated on both schedule-based and retrospective networks, we compute and compare a variety of accessibility measures. We find that origin-based accessibility even when averaged over one-hour periods can vary widely between locations. Origins with lower scheduled access tend to produce less reliable estimates with more variability from hour to hour in real accessibility, while higher access zones seem to converge on an estimate 5-15{\%} lower than the schedule predicts. Such over-and under-predictions exhibit strong spatial patterns which should be of concern to those using accessibility metrics in statistical models. Momentary measures of accessibility are briefly discussed and found to be weakly related to momentary changes in real access. These findings bring into question the validity of some recent applications of GTFS data and point the way toward more robust methods for calculating accessibility.},

abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

abstract = {The potential role of smart card data for travel behaviour analysis is considered. Case studies of smart card experience in Britain are examined, of the pensioner concessionary pass in Southport, Merseyside, and the commercially operated scheme in Bradford. The nature of smart card data puts an emphasis on concept definition and rules-based processing. Using smart card data, estimates may be made of card turnover rates, trip rates per card on issue, and inferences made of the proportion of linked trips. In comparison with existing data sources, much larger samples may be obtained, and behaviour analysed over much longer periods. However, there are limitations, mainly that trip length is not recorded on systems based on validating cards only on entry to a bus, and that certain types of data still require direct survey methods for their collection (such as journey purpose). Hence, a complementary role may be identified for smart card data vis a vis existing data collection methods, rather than entirely superseding them. Transport service providers should also ensure that their smart card retailing strategy does not undermine the quality of the data in the initial years of the scheme, therefore limiting its use during this period. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The resultant origin–interchange–destination flows (and the origin–destination (OD) matrices that comprise those flows), however, represent only a sample of total ridership, as they contain only those journeys made using the AFC payment method that have been successfully recorded or inferred. This paper presents a method for scaling passenger-journey flows (i.e., linked-trip flows) using additional information from passenger counts at each station gate and bus farebox, thereby estimating the flows of non-AFC passengers and of AFC passengers whose journeys were not successfully inferred. The proposed method is applied to a hypothetical test network and to AFC and AVL data from London's multimodal public transit network. Because London requires AFC transactions upon both entry and exit for rail trips, a rail-only OD matrix is extracted from the estimated multimodal linked-trip flows, and is compared to a rail OD matrix generated using the iterative proportional fitting method.},

Each day, TriMet buses travel Portland's city and suburban streets on more than 90 different bus routes, collecting data at each scheduled and unscheduled stop.

Gould (1969) once stated that it is a `slippery notion {\{}{\ldots}{\}} one of those common terms that everyone uses until faced with the problem of defining and measuring it'. Considerable research over the last 40 years has been devoted to defining and measuring accessibility, ranging from access to jobs within an hour's travel time to the ease at which given places can be reached. This article is concerned with the measurement of access provided by transit. It includes a review of past work on measuring accessibility in general and with respect to transit services in particular. From this overview of the literature, it can be seen that current methods fall short in measuring transit service access in several meaningful aspects. Based on this review and critique, we propose new refinements that can be used to help overcome some of these shortcomings. As a part of this, we define an extended GIS data structure to handle temporal elements of transit service. To demonstrate the value of these new measures, examples are presented with respect to mapping accessibility of transit services in Santa Barbara, California. Finally, we show how these measures can be used to develop a framework for supporting transit service analysis and planning.},

Comparatively, less attention has been paid to the study of variability, which, however, has been argued as equally important as regularities, since variability identifies diversity. In a transport network, variability exists from person to person, from place to place, and from day to day. In this paper, we present a set of measuring of variability at individual and aggregated levels using multi-day smart-card data. Statistical analysis, correlation matrix and network-based clustering methods are applied and potential use of measured results for urban applications are also discussed. We take Singapore as a case study and use one-week smart-card data for analysis. An interesting finding is that though the number of trips and mobility patterns varies from day to day, the overall spatial structure of urban movement always remains the same throughout a week. This finding showed that a systemic framework with well-organized analytical methods is indeed, necessary for extracting variability that may change at different levels and consequently for uncovering different aspects of dynamics, namely transit, social and urban dynamics. We consider this paper as a tentative work toward such generic framework for measuring variability and it can be used as a reference for other research work in such a direction.},

abstract = {A methodology for estimating the destination of passenger journeys from automated fare collection (AFC) system data is described. It proposes new spatial validation features to increase the accuracy of destination inference results and to verify key assumptions present in previous origin–destination estimation literature. The methodology applies to entry-only system configurations combined with distance-based fare structures, and it aims to enhance raw AFC system data with the destination of individual journeys. This paper describes an algorithm developed to implement the methodology and the results from its application to bus service data from Porto. The data relate to an AFC system integrated with an automatic vehicle location system that records a transaction for each passenger boarding a bus, containing attributes regarding the route, the vehicle, and the travel card used, along with the time and the location where the journey began. Some of these are recorded for the purpose of allowing onboard ticket inspection but additionally enable innovative spatial validation features introduced by the methodology. The results led to the conclusion that the methodology is effective for estimating journey destinations at the disaggregate level and identifies false positives reliably.},

abstract = {Accessibility to jobs by transit is increasingly incorporated into transportation and land-use planning objectives, as it is proven to be a relevant indicator for assessing land-use and transport performance. With a rise in time-sensitive accessibility measures, choosing the appropriate measure is increasingly challenging for engineers, planners and policy-makers. This research presents a comparative analysis of three accessibility measures, two of which are time-sensitive. Relative accessibility measures are generated for five time periods based on a) constant transit service and number of jobs (constant); b) variable transit service and constant number of jobs (static) and c) variable transit service and variable number of jobs available (dynamic). The measures are first assessed by incorporating them into a transit mode share model. Interestingly, findings show that all three measures behaved similarly in the three regression models. Furthermore, all accessibility measures are found to be highly correlated. The study suggests that the most commonly used accessibility measure (constant measure at 8 am) is representative of the relative accessibility (static or dynamic) over the course of the day and is thus appropriate and meaningful to be used by policy-makers, engineers and planners.},

abstract = {Obtaining load profiles of transit vehicles has remained as a difficult task for transit operators because of technical and financial constraints. Although a significant advance in transit demand and supply data collection has been achieved over the past decade, information related to load profiles at the vehicular level is either impossible or very difficult to retrieve from them. It is not even uncommon to see that these data are underutilized by transit operators owing to considerable deficiencies and shortcomings in the data themselves, and/or the processing algorithms needed to process them. This study is therefore dedicated to addressing this challenge that has largely been overlooked by both researchers and practitioners. First, the issues which hinder the construction of load profiles based on three prevailing transit data sources are identified, including automatic fare collection (AFC), automatic vehicle location (AVL), and general transit feed specification (GTFS) data. Second, a methodology is developed for sequentially addressing all the issues and generating desirable vehicle load profiles. The methodology consists of four steps, including (1) data pre-processing, (2) matching trips in GTFS and AVL, (3) matching passenger rides to vehicle trajectories, and (4) improving vehicle trajectories. The resulting spatiotemporal load profiles of transit vehicles enable detailed investigation into vehicle movements and demand patterns over time and space, including service utilization and the propagation of delays and crowding. Data collected from the urban transit network in The Hague, The Netherlands are used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The visualization of spatiotemporal load profiles through space-time seat occupancy graphs provides operators with a compact and powerful reference for the improvement of their services. Knowing the on-board load of transit vehicles is key to improving transit services from both planning and operational perspectives. However, obtaining such information for transit operators has remained as a difficult task for a long time because of technical and financial constraints. Although manual surveys have often been used to estimate on-board passenger loads, such surveys are too costly to be conducted daily over all offered services , and are also subject to error and bias. Opportunities to change this situation, however, have emerged in recent years with the fast-growing data richness in transit research and practice, including automatic vehicle location (AVL) (1); automatic fare collection (AFC) (2, 3); and general transit feed specification (GTFS) data (4, 5). In many cities and regions around the world, transit demand and supply data have been continuously collected and managed with fine granularity, accuracy, and spatiotem-poral scale. Notwithstanding, it is not uncommon to see transit operators still struggle to obtain some fundamentally important information, such as service utilization (i.e., passenger load). Data are often underutilized as a result of considerable deficiencies and shortcomings that can be frequently overlooked. To unlock their potential, it becomes necessary to develop sound techniques to overcome these issues and achieve valuable information, such as the transit vehicle load, by processing and integrating different data sources, including AFC, AVL, and GTFS. The current study is therefore dedicated to this specific challenge. To the best of the authors' knowledge, few scientific studies and practical reports have attempted to address a similar problem. One of the main causes for this scarcity could be the rather limited access to multiple transit data sets from the same period by researchers. In many cases, only a single data source is available and the studies},

abstract = {This manuscript summarizes/reviews the current trends of ride-sharing services, which can be a supplement to or replacement of conventional transit services. It argues that smartcard data can be utilized to identify low-demand transit routes, where emerging ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft can play a role as a supplement to, or replacement of transit services along those routes. It outlines transferrable procedures and methods that can be used to process smartcard data and to define, identify and visualize low-demand transit routes. In an empirical study, it shows that some low-demand transit routes can probably be replaced by Uber at a lower level of overall costs. But the empirical study also indicates that the replacement can be challenging in reality given issues such as unwillingness or difficulties of local transit agencies and ride-sharing service providers in sharing financial information regarding their services, latent demand for private ride-sharing services, social equity and political/legal concerns over the introduction of private ride-sharing services into the transit-service market and usage of public funding for residents/riders to use private ride-sharing services.},

It is necessary to use appropriate data abstraction methods. We suggest a method for spatial generalization and aggregation of movement data, which transforms trajectories into aggregate flows between areas. It is assumed that no predefined areas are given. We have devised a special method for partitioning the underlying territory into appropriate areas. The method is based on extracting significant points from the trajectories. The resulting abstraction conveys essential characteristics of the movement. The degree of abstraction can be controlled through the parameters of the method. We introduce local and global numeric measures of the quality of the generalization, and suggest an approach to improve the quality in selected parts of the territory where this is deemed necessary. The suggested method can be used in interactive visual exploration of movement data and for creating legible flow maps for presentation purposes.},

abstract = {Although smart card fare data has recently become more prevalent as a rich, comprehensive and continuous source of information, there is still some missing information which inhibits its capability in the research field. One key missing piece of information is the passengers' trip purpose. This paper investigates the potential of the smart card data to infer passengers' trip purpose, thereby reducing the use of the expensive and time-consuming Household Travel Surveys (HTS). On this basis, an improved model has been proposed, calibrated and validated for trip purpose inference by integrating different data sources, namely: HTS, a land use database, the South East Queensland Strategic Transport Model (SEQSTM), the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data, O-D survey data, and most importantly the unique smart card fare data from Brisbane, Queensland. As smart card fare data does not record passengers' trip purpose, the calibration and validation procedures are performed on HTS data. Based on the validation results, the proposed methodology shows a strong capability to predict trip purpose at a high level of accuracy. The results show an overall 67{\%} correct inference after applying spatial attributes, but the correct inference increases to 78{\%} after applying temporal attributes. Different trip purposes show different sensitivities to the applied spatial and temporal attributes. Work and home trips have the highest correct inference results, at 92{\%} and 96{\%}, respectively. Furthermore, the results of correct inference for shopping and education trips improved after applying the temporal attributes.},

The modern GPS based tracking systems and the electronic tickets are producing lots of data, and we could use them, for improving the service level.

Thanks to the spread of data mining, these tools are not appearing only in marketing research, but also in the most various kind of scientific areas and they are advertising a new scientific revolution. Although the importance of these data sources is essential it is not widespread in transport planning except in some specific areas. The smart card systems store the number of boarding passengers and in some cases also the alighting values. From the passengers' boarding and alighting information in a stop point we can create a time series, which shows the behavior type of the given stop points presented on graphic curves. With the help of different clustering and classification processes, these curves can be turned into groups and we can observe these groups of stop points which are defining separated zones. This is the basic step in transport modelling and the zones were determined by manual methods usually. In this paper we examine clustering and classification methods compared to each other and check the usability of different distance measurement techniques.

A number of different measures of accessibility, defined as the potential to reach spatially dispersed opportunities, have been proposed in the literature, and used to address various substantive planning and policy questions. Our objective in this paper is to conduct a review of various commonly used measures of accessibility, with a particular view to clarifying their normative (i.e. prescriptive), as well as positive (i.e. descriptive) aspects. This is a distinction that has seldom been made in the literature and that helps to better understand the meaning of alternative ways to implement the concept of accessibility. Our discussion of the positive and normative aspects of accessibility measurements is illustrated using the city of Montreal, Canada, as a case study. The example highlights the differences in the measured levels of accessibility depending on implementation. Comparison of the two by means of a relative indicator of accessibility helps to identify the gap between desired (as normative defined) and actual (as revealed) accessibility levels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In this paper, an in-depth examination of ride-hailing use in Santiago de Chile is presented, based on data from an intercept survey applied in 2017 across the city. First, a sociodemographic analysis of ride-hailing users, usage habits and trip characteristics is introduced, together with a discussion on the substitution and complementarity of ride-hailing with existing public transport. It is found that (i) the most substituted modes by ride-hailing are public transport and traditional taxis, and (ii) for every ride-hailing rider that combines with public transport, there are 11 riders that substitute public transport. Then, generalised ordinal logit models are estimated, which show that (iii) the probability of sharing a (non-pooled) ride-hailing trip decreases as a function of the rider household income and increases for leisure trips, and (iv) the monthly frequency of ride-hailing use is larger for wealthier and younger travellers, whereas car availability is not statistically significant to explain frequency of ride-hailing use once controlling for age and income, a finding that is at odds with previous ride-hailing studies. To our knowledge, the type of insights resulting from this paper have only been obtained before in studies with data from the United States; we position our findings in this extant literature and discuss policy implications of our results for the legal regulation of ride-hailing services in Chile.

abstract = {The increased availability of transit schedules from web sites or travel planners as well as more disaggregate data has led to a growing interest in creating individual public transportation accessibility measures. However, used extensively, standard GIS software does not have direct capabilities to integrate transit schedules into multimodal networks and measure space–time-based accessibility. This has caused authors to either simplify travel time elements or develop tools to overcome these challenges. In this paper we aim to describe and implement a method that enables integrating time-table data from a travel planner into a multimodal network model using simple SQL (structured query language) programming and standard GIS. The method presented here integrates all parts of travelling by public transportation from individual home addresses to all reachable transit stops within different travel time thresholds. The method is used successfully to create a multimodal travel-time network model of the Capital Region of Denmark comprising bus, train, light rail, metro, and ferry as well as integrating walking or cycling to stops. Here, the individual accessibility is defined as accessibility areas. The accessibility areas are created at morning rush hour for a study population of 29 447 individuals and a few examples of accessibility areas are presented. The results show a big difference in individual public transportation accessibility in the region. In addition, how the transit network is accessed, whether it is at the nearest stop or at all stops within 1 km walking distance or 3 km cycling distance, leads to very different accessibility areas.},

abstract = {Spatial interaction (SI) is the process whereby entities at different points in physical space make contacts, demand/supply decisions or locational choices. The entities can be individuals or firms and the choices can include housing, jobs, production quantities, exports, imports, face--to--face contacts, schools, retail centres and activity centres. The first SI models can be grouped under the generic heading gravity models. Their main characteristic is that they model the behaviour of demand or supply segments, rather than that of individuals and firms. This article traces the development of these models from their inception in the early part of the twentieth century to the present. The key advances include the replacement of the gravity analogy by the more general concepts of entropy or information theory, a statistical framework commonly used in physics. With the arrival of the regional science paradigm over 50 years ago, a key challenge has been to broaden these models compared to those arising in spatial economics, thus arriving at a more inclusive probabilistic framework. These efforts are discussed here, as well as inclusion of geographical advances, embracing activities as generators of travel, time--geography, recognition of spatial interdependencies, and use of neuro--computing principles.},

abstract = {The temporal dimensions of public transit accessibility have recently garnered an increasing amount of interest. However, the existing literature on transit accessibility is heavily based on oversimplified assumptions that transit services operate at deterministic speeds using predetermined timetables. These measurements may overesti- mate transit accessibility, especially for largemetropolitan areas where inter- and intra-modal transfers are frequent. To handle travel time uncertainty, a multi-modal transit accessibility modeling approach is proposed to account for realistic variations in travel time and service reliability. The proposed approach is applied to themapping of transit accessibility in Shenzhen (China), where transit services exhibit significant travel time variations over space and time. Compared to traditional transit accessibilitymeasures, our method has been demon- strated to better capture intrinsic spatial and temporal accessibility variations withcomplexmulti-modal transit networks.Normaldistribu- tion of inter-stop travel times and constant travel speed between GPS sampling points are assumed to simply the computation, which we consider to adjust in future studies to better quantify the dynamics of transit accessibility across space and time.},

abstract = {Conventional location-based accessibility measures are static and cannot represent accessibility fluctuations at different times of day. To fill this gap, this study proposes location-based space-time accessibility measures to capture the temporal variation of location-based accessibility. Using the space-time utility perspective, the accessibility of a location is conceptualized as the space-time utility offered by a set of facilities accessible from the location. Individuals' facility choice behaviors among multiple alternatives are explicitly considered. A time-dependent facility attractiveness function is introduced to represent the temporal variation of individuals' needs to perform activities at a certain facility. The introduced function is formulated as two components: a time-invariant component representing individual satisfactions derived from activity participation at the facility, and a time-varying component expressing individuals' dynamic intensities to perform a certain type of activities at different times of day. To demonstrate the applicability of these proposed measures, a comprehensive case study has been carried out in Wuhan, China. The results of the case study show that the proposed measures can well capture the temporal variation of accessibility, due to the dynamics both of traffic conditions and of individuals' intensities in performing activities at different times of day. The proposed measures require moderate level of data, in terms of rich facility information; and most of these data could be extracted from social media applications.},

abstract = {Transit fares are an effective tool for demand management. Transit agencies can raise revenue or relieve overcrowding via fare increases, but they are always confronted with the possibility of heavy ridership losses. Therefore, the outcome of fare changes should be evaluated before implementation. In this work, a methodology was formulated based on elasticity and exhaustive transit card data, and a network approach was proposed to assess the influence of distance-based fare increases on ridership and revenue. The approach was applied to a fare change plan for Beijing Metro. The price elasticities of demand for Beijing Metro at various fare levels and trip distances were tabulated from a stated preference survey. Trip data recorded by an automatic fare collection system was used alongside the topology of the Beijing Metro system to calculate the shortest path lengths between all station pairs, the origin-destination matrix, and trip lengths. Finally, three fare increase alternatives (high, medium, and low) were evaluated in terms of their impact on ridership and revenue. The results demonstrated that smart card data have great potential with regard to fare change evaluation. According to smart card data for a large transit network, the statistical frequency of trip lengths is more highly concentrated than that of the shortest path length. Moreover, the majority of the total trips have a length of around 15. km, and these are the most sensitive to fare increases. Specific attention should be paid to this characteristic when developing fare change plans to manage demand or raise revenue.},

abstract = {As transit agencies increasingly adopt the use of Automatic Passenger Count (APC) technologies, a large amount of boarding and alighting data are being amassed on an ongoing basis. These datasets offer opportunities to infer good estimates of passenger origin-destination (OD) flows. In this study, a method is proposed to estimate transit route passenger OD flow matrices for time-of-day periods based on OD flow information derived from labor-intensive onboard surveys and the large quantities of APC data that are becoming available. The computational feasibility of the proposed method is established and its accuracy is empirically evaluated using differences between the estimated OD flows and ground-truth observations on an operational bus route. To interpret the empirical differences from the ground-truth estimates, differences are also computed when using the state-of-the-practice Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method to estimate the OD flows. The empirical results show that when using sufficient quantities of boarding and alighting data that can be readily obtained from APC-equipped buses, the estimates determined by the proposed method are better than those determined by the IPF method when no or a small sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available and of similar quality to those determined by the IPF method when a large sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available. Therefore, the proposed method offers the opportunity to forgo conducting costly onboard surveys for the purpose of OD flow estimation.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a significant increase of temporally variable analyses of accessibility by public transport as a result of the increased availability of open and standardized time table information in the form of GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data. To date, very little attention has been paid to systematically analyze the impact of temporal resolutions on the results. Different authors have applied different standards, often in an ad-hoc manner. In this study, we address the loss of precision associated with a stepwise reduction of the temporal resolution of travel time estimations based on GTFS data for the city of Szczecin in Poland. The paper aims to provide guidance to researchers and practitioners on the selection of appropriate temporal resolutions in accessibility studies. We test four sampling methods in order to analyze four different public transport frequency scenarios, three types of accessibility measures (travel time to the nearest provider, cumulative opportunities measure and potential accessibility) and seven types of destinations ranging from high to low centrality. Additionally, the impact on spatial disparities is explored using the Gini coefficient. We find that a reduction of temporal resolution is associated with a decrease in precision of public transport accessibility measurement. However, with up to 5-min resolutions this reduction is negligible, while computational time is reduced fivefold, compared to a 1-min resolution benchmark. Lower temporal resolutions still provide relatively precise estimations of travel times and accessibility measures. However, further resolution reductions are associated with decreasing reductions of computational time. As a result, we argue that 15-min temporal resolution provides a good balance between precision and computational time while providing very precise estimations of Gini coefficients (errors ≤0.001). A non-linear relationship is found between the public transport frequency and the loss of precision, with lower frequencies leading to a greater loss in precision. More attention should be paid to highly centralized services, in particular when analyzed using proximity and cumulative opportunities measures. Finally, the cumulative opportunities measure is found to be highly sensitive to changes in the temporal resolution and not suited for time-sensitive accessibility analysis.},

We stress some important implications, insights and consequences of different assumptions relating to these theories, many of which we feel have been underappreciated in much of the CBA literature and practice. We derive a welfare rule including a social cost for monetary redistributions and show the implications for how the VTTS can be defined in different choice situations. Crucially, the applicable VTTS definition depends on whether travel costs (fares) are under public control and to whom benefits accrue in the long run. In some choice situations, the VTTS should be controlled for differences in income, but it is important to always take into account differences in marginal utilities of time (e.g. across travel time components, modes and trip purposes).

abstract = {Transaction data from public transit smart cards represent a continuous stream of detailed travel information for transit demand modeling. Although certain aspects of information are incomplete in unprocessed data, efforts are devoted to deriving a more comprehensive understanding of the system and its users from partial information through data enrichment processes, with a long-term goal of establishing a dynamic model of demand. On the basis of previous work, methods are proposed to estimate the arrival time of bus runs at the stop level by using temporal constraints and to identify linked trips by using spatial-temporal concepts. These enrichments lead to the reconstruction of individual itineraries, the analysis of transfer activity, and the synthesis of vehicle load profiles. The latter provide planners with a detailed spatial-temporal progression of each run, origin and destination stops for each individual transaction, and boarding and alighting activity at each stop. The study draws on more than 37,000 smart card boarding transactions of an average weekday from a midsize transit agency. Results suggest that linked trips represent slightly above 10{\%} of the total number of transactions in the network and the smart card system overestimates the proportion of linked trips by nearly 40{\%}. The outcome is promising and lays a foundation to further enrich the itineraries by associating the boarding and alighting stops with trip generators, deriving trip purposes, and performing multiday analysis.},

Nevertheless, its use by practitioners is generally limited. The goal of this study is to explore the challenges and opportunities experienced by land use and transportation practitioners to use accessibility metrics in their work. In order to achieve this objective, a survey on the use of accessibility metrics was conducted among 343 practitioners around the world. Findings from the survey show a gap between knowledge of the concept of accessibility and its use by land use and transportation practitioners. While 90{\%} of the respondents are familiar with the concept, only 55{\%} stated that they use accessibility metrics in their work. Whereas lack of support and interest does not appear to be a major obstacle to using accessibility metrics, lack of knowledge and data are highlighted as the main barriers to the use of metrics in practice. These results suggest that further training and collaboration is required to support the use of metrics by practitioners. Furthermore, including clear accessibility indicators in planning documents is key to promoting the use of metrics in policy and practice, as it was stated as a main reason motivating the generation of accessibility metrics. This research highlights potential avenues to support the integration of accessibility metrics in practice and is of relevance to researchers, planners and policy-makers wishing to foster accessibility-based planning approaches.},

Two approaches to the measurement of accessibility aggregate accessibility measures and the space-time geography framework are described. It is suggested that isochrones (lines of equal travel time) are a natural way to combine these approaches in a GIS setting. A desktop GIS application has been developed which can automatically generate isochrones for travel by public transport. The application successfully copes with the complexity of the public transport of a large city (Glasgow), comprising bus, rail, and underground services. Journeys may include an initial walk to a public transport stop, several interchanges between services of the same or different modes, and a final walk. Options provide for plotting isochrones for journeys by bus only or train only; and for exact or approximate isochrones, the latter generated more quickly. The application is described in some detail, and assessed. Sample outputs are presented, including an example involving further processing of isochrones to produce a constrained accessibility map, which demonstrates the generality of this approach.},

abstract = {Investments in public transit infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean often aim to reduce spatial and social inequalities by improving accessibility to jobs and other opportunities. The Metropolitano, Lima's BRT project at inception, had, as one of its central goals, to connect low income populations living in the peripheries to jobs in the city center. We examine the contribution of Lima's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system to accessibility to employment in the city, particularly for low-income public transit users. We build on secondary datasets of employment, household socio-demographics and Origin-Destination surveys before and after the BRT began operations to assess its effects on potential accessibility to employment. Findings suggest that the BRT line reduced travel times to reach jobs, in comparison with traditional public transport in the city, amongst populations living within walking distance of the system. However, we also find that the coverage of the BRT is minimal in areas with high concentrations of poor and extreme poor populations, limiting the equitability of the accessibility improvements. We present a reflection on the distributional effects of BRT infrastructure and services, discussing policy avenues that can improve the prospects for BRT system investments to include the poor in their mobility benefits.},

abstract = {We put forward a new data object called the public transit travel time cube and demonstrate how the cube can be used in the analysis of transit travel time changes over space and time. The travel time cube contains the shortest path transit travel time between sets of origins and destinations in the city, at all times of day. Once computed, a wide range of investigations become readily available to the transit planner or transportation researcher. We conduct three demonstrative analyses using travel time cubes for the Wasatch Front, Utah and the Portland region in Oregon. Our studies investigate how travel times were impacted by service cuts and expansions in the two regions respectively and the impact this had on jobs accessibility. We also use the travel time cube to study the last mile problem, and compute the travel time savings and the stability gained by solving the last mile problem with bicycling. The paper concludes with an expanded discussion on the merits of the travel time cube and outlines four avenues for continued research.},

abstract = {Identifying changes in the spatial structure of cities is a prerequisite for the development and validation of adequate planning strategies. Nevertheless, current methods of measurement are becoming ever more challenged by increasingly dispersed forms of urban organisation. Being motivated by the recent availability of large-scale data on human activities, this paper proposes a new quantitative measure for the centrality of locations, taking into account both the number of people attracted to different locations and the diversity of their activities. This 'centrality index' allows for the identification of functional urban centres and for a systematic tracking of their relative importance over time. As a case study, the proposed index is applied to extensive travel survey data in Singapore for the years 1997, 2004 and 2008. It is shown that, on the one hand, the city-state has been developing rapidly towards a polycentric urban form that compares rather closely with the official urban development plan. On the other hand, however, the downtown core has strongly gained in importance, and this can be largely attributed to the extension of the public transit system.},

abstract = {Accessibility and mobility are fundamental conditions of urban life today, which reinforces the need to evaluate the dynamics of access to and use of the public transport system in large cities that have experienced serious traffic and congestion problems. The present article analyses the levels of accessibility by bus in the city of Belo Horizonte / MG, including its relationship with the levels of urban mobility. To this end, accessibility indicators for bus and the mobility of the population are proposed. In addition, indicators of global and local regression models were evaluated, considering accessibility as an explanatory variable. In general, the results indicate a strong regional variation in the municipality of Belo Horizonte and suggest that accessibility to public transport by bus does not directly lead to effective mobility. Some regions have a greater discrepancy between the levels of accessibility and mobility, especially those located in peripheral areas where access to the bus transport system is lower than expected by the methodology, given the existing levels of mobility. The results, albeit essentially exploratory, may be useful to support the formulation of constructive measures, in order to minimize possible distortions in the provision of accessibility, encouraging the best use of mobility opportunities in urban space.},

abstract = {Planning policy goals now emphasise the need to plan for accessibility and it is clear that increasing the mode share of public transport is a key requirement. One of the enduring issues has been how to embed these policy aspirations into mainstream planning practice. There is considerable diversity of approach to measuring accessibility with no single perfect accessibility measure. Applications of accessibility tools in planning practice have tended to be single issue focussed. There remains a gap in accessibility tool development capable of providing a multi-focus perspective both on land use and transport integration, which also consider accessibility as a city wide application where access from every centre to every other centre is considered. In addition to these shortcomings, there is also a strong need for accessibility tools that can enhance the understanding of land use transport integration, not only for professional practitioners but for a wider range of stakeholders. To achieve this, the inputs and outputs of accessibility tools need to be communicated in an 'accessible' way too.This paper demonstrates the application of a new accessibility planning tool and the way in which it has functioned as a trans-disciplinary communication tool to demonstrate the integration between land use and transport in a way that practitioners and stakeholders can fully understand. We show that it is critical to apply several measures in combination in order to present the necessary information to inform debate and deliberation. The most important driver, however, will be to apply measures framed around the way individuals make decisions in their travel plans-particularly in choosing between car and public transport. We argue that the dissemination of accessibility measures through visually well-represented media can significantly enhance understanding, making a contribution towards a productive discourse on future directions for urban form and mobility. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this study, we define the Bus Lines Synchronization Problem that determines the frequency for each line (regarding the even headway), the timetable (including holding times for buses at transfer stops), and passenger-route assignments to minimize the sum of passenger and operational costs. We propose a nonlinear mixed integer formulation with time-indexed variables which allow representing the route choice for passengers and different types of costs. We implement an iterative heuristic algorithm based on fixing variables and solving a simplified formulation with a commercial solver. We implement our proposed heuristic on the transit network in Santiago, Chile.

The review covers both choice set generation and choice process, since present research directions show growing interest in understanding the role of choice set size and composition on model estimation and flow prediction, while past research directions illustrate larger efforts toward the enhancement of stochastic route choice models rather than toward the development of realistic choice set generation methods.

abstract = {Assessing the performance of public transit services has long been an important yet challenging issue for transportation agencies and researchers. Transit service performance measurement reflects a very first step towards an efficient and proactive management, where public transit agencies are increasingly pressured to provide high-quality services in spite of constrained resources. However, the performance evaluation of transit services is complicated by an array of quantitative measures available to assess the goals and the diversity in the goals themselves, which usually include improving operational efficiency and providing equitable access. While much previous work has examined public transit services for achieving optimal operational efficiency and/or access equity separately, the interplay of the two has rarely been investigated to date. This article proposes a new method for evaluating the overall performance of public transit services via a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA), Geographic Information System (GIS), and multi-objective spatial optimization techniques. The new method is applied to assessing the performance of fixed route bus services operated by the Utah Transit Authorities (UTA) in the Wasatch Front, Utah. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively account for operational efficiency and access equity in an integrated framework, providing a more comprehensive assessment for transit service performance.},

We choose to divide the urban area into a grid and organizing the road infrastructure as segments in a graph. Further, at a given time we can make an assumption regarding the congestion level in a specific area taking into account the visits for each vehicle, using the GPS trace data. Over time, the visited segments will settle into a pattern and vary periodically. In this study we will use R software in conjunction with a set of libraries. They provide an environment in which we can perform statistical analysis and produce graphics to annotate different results. Our objective is to identify contiguous set of road segments and time intervals which have the largest statistically significant relevance in forming traffic patterns. Taking into account the number of drivers that submitted their routes in correlation with the entire population on New Haven we can state that a 2-3{\%} penetration rate of smart phones is enough to provide accurate measurements of the traffic flow and identification of traffic patterns.},

Recent advances in data availability provide new opportunities to understand commuting patterns efficiently and effectively. This study develops a series of data mining methods to identify the spatiotemporal commuting patterns of Beijing public transit riders. Using one-month transit smart card data, we measure spatiotemporal regularity of individual commuters, including residence, workplace, and departure time. This data could be used to identify transit commuters by leveraging spatial clustering and multi-criteria decision analysis approaches. A disaggregated-level survey is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods with a commuter identification accuracy that reaches as high as 94.1{\%}. By visualizing the spatial distribution of the homes and workplaces of transit commuters, we determine a clear disparity between commuters and noncommuters and confirm the existence of job–house imbalance in Beijing. The findings provide useful insights for policymakers to shape a more balanced job–housing relationship by adjusting the monocentric urban structure of Beijing. In addition, the extracted individual-level commuting patterns can be used as valuable information for public transit network design and optimization. These strategies are expected to reduce car dependency, shorten excess commute, and alleviate traffic congestion.},

In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada's eight largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities, and by travel mode. {\textcopyright} 2019 The Ohio State University},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany. The accuracy of transit assignment plays an important role in the successful design and operation of a transit system. The majority of previous studies on validating transit assignment models has used limited survey data or has lacked a large-scale multimodal and high quality dataset. Considering the advantages of smart card [automatic fare collection (AFC)] systems, the aims of this study are to put forward a methodological framework to validate existing transit assignment models and to quantify the performance of these models. Our study combines data from three sources: the General Transit Feed Specification, an AFC system, and a strategic transport model from a large-scale multimodal public transport network, namely the South-East Queensland (SEQ) network in Australia. The AFC system in SEQ has provided a very large and highly accurate dataset on passenger boardings and alightings for the three transit modes of bus, rail and ferry. Following a data analysis, an origin–destination trip matrix is estimated for the AM peak period using AFC data as an input to the transit assignment model. Then, the results of the transit assignment model are compared with the actual passengers' route choices over the same period, at different levels of aggregation. The model performance is quantified by each route (and direction), by each segment of each route (and direction), and by each stop. The results indicate that relatively tighter  thresholds are required to validate the transit assignment at the segment level than at the stop level. Furthermore, the validation results indicate that the greatest error is realized for the bus mode, while the level of accuracy in the rail mode is the best. The results suggest a segment-level analysis should be used as the most useful level of aggregation for future calibration and validation of transit assignment models.},

abstract = {As transit agencies increasingly adopt the use of Automatic Passenger Count (APC) technologies, a large amount of boarding and alighting data are being amassed on an ongoing basis. These datasets offer opportunities to infer good estimates of passenger origin-destination (OD) flows. In this study, a method is proposed to estimate transit route passenger OD flow matrices for time-of-day periods based on OD flow information derived from labor-intensive onboard surveys and the large quantities of APC data that are becoming available. The computational feasibility of the proposed method is established and its accuracy is empirically evaluated using differences between the estimated OD flows and ground-truth observations on an operational bus route. To interpret the empirical differences from the ground-truth estimates, differences are also computed when using the state-of-the-practice Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) method to estimate the OD flows. The empirical results show that when using sufficient quantities of boarding and alighting data that can be readily obtained from APC-equipped buses, the estimates determined by the proposed method are better than those determined by the IPF method when no or a small sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available and of similar quality to those determined by the IPF method when a large sample sized onboard OD flow survey dataset is available. Therefore, the proposed method offers the opportunity to forgo conducting costly onboard surveys for the purpose of OD flow estimation.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to model the travel behaviour of socially disadvantaged population segments in the United Kingdom (UK) using the data from the UK National Travel Survey 2002-2010. This was achieved by introducing additional socioeconomic variables into a standard national-level trip end model (TEM) and using purpose-based analysis of the travel behaviours of certain key socially disadvantaged groups. Specifically the paper aims to explore how far the economic and social disadvantages of these individuals can be used to explain the inequalities in their travel behaviours. The models demonstrated important differences in travel behaviours according to household income, presence of children in the household, possession of a driver's licence and belonging to a vulnerable population group, such as being disabled, non-white or having single parent household status. In the case of household income, there was a non-linear relationship with trip frequency and a linear one with distance travelled. The recent economic austerity measures that have been introduced in the UK and many other European countries have led to major cutbacks in public subsidies for socially necessary transport services, making results such as these increasingly important for transport policy decision-making. The results indicate that the inclusion of additional socioeconomic variables is useful for identifying significant differences in the trip patterns and distances travelled by low-income.},

abstract = {An attractive topic in transportation practice is transit ridership estimation. Reliable estimates are beneficial to spatial structuring, facility design, and vehicle operation, as well as financial and labor management. Traditional ridership estimation approaches mainly rely on regression models that consider subway fares, population, and employment distribution in surrounding areas. Yet consideration of ridership's spatial dependency is largely lacking in these models. This paper recognizes the spatial effect by estimating the ridership of the new Second Avenue Subway in New York City using a network Kriging method. Network distance, instead of Euclidean distance, is used to reflect the fact that subway stations are only connected by subway tunnels. Results show that the new service should effectively relieve the traffic burden on other currently crowded subway lines.},

Their main goal is to gather revenue in a more efficient way. In addition to this purpose, they have multiple indirect benefits to transport researchers. This rich data is obtained from daily transactions that mainly occur when a passenger boards or alights a public transit vehicle. They have some features that are investigated in recent studies. Considering volume, longitudinal nature, level of details, and accuracy of the AFC data, this data creates new opportunities for researchers to study public transit systems and travel behaviour of passengers in order to develop various applications, such as origin-destination (OD) estimation, travel pattern mining, trip purpose detection, route choice modelling, transit performance indicators, and identifying policy alternatives. This paper reviews the previous studies on the AFC data focusing on studies after 2010. It will also make suggestions for the direction future studies may wish to take.},

abstract = {Accessibility measures are usually designed to be objective representations of the 'real' conditions to provide a baseline for planning decisions and to track change over time. A wide range of approaches to measuring accessibility have been developed, usually based largely on quantifiable factors such as journey time. The simplest of these are based on the time taken to reach the nearest destination from an origin point. Destinations might include healthcare, education, employment or supermarkets, amongst others.This paper posits that people's perceptions and experiences may differ from objectively measured conditions and crucially may be more important for understanding behaviour. An understanding of the difference between objective and subjective measures, and how they relate to each other is therefore vital before using either measure to inform policy decisions. This paper compares two approaches to measuring journey time accessibility to a range of destinations using objective measures of accessibility, calculated using GIS and individuals' self reported values, based on travel survey data.Using two publically available datasets for England this paper explores the two approaches to measuring journey time accessibility to a range of destinations. Discordance between the two is found. Survey reported measures are found to be greater than objective measures in urban areas, but less in rural areas. This can be understood partly due to differences both between objective measures and reality and between perceptions and reality.},

In a city where the bus is the main mode of public transport, the QBC initiative has resulted in decreased commute times and increased ridership. QBCs operate on dedicated traffic lanes between the hours of 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. and in certain instances on a 24-h basis. The performance of the Malahide QBC, which extends 7.5 km (4.7 mi) from the city center to the northeast of the city, is measured by examining service coverage, headway, and transit/automobile travel time (the difference in travel time between transit and private vehicles). The Transit Capacity and Quality of Service Manual (TCQSM) is used to provide quality of service measurements on the corridor to evaluate its performance. Data for the TCQSM analysis were taken from an automatic license plate recognition system that was installed on the Malahide QBC in 2003. Future plans for the QBC network are presented, along with a concluding examination of how QBCs play a role in providing a more efficient public transport system in Dublin.},

To quantify, monitor and visualise the TSAs of the Southeast Queensland (SEQ), this study analyses half-year smartcard data between 2012 and 2013 from TransLink, the transit agency for SEQ. Four scenarios are prescribed and four corresponding metrics (the minimum, actual, random and maximum travels) are calculated, which reflect transit riders' different levels of elasticity of distance travelled (EDT) relative to the cost of travel within or between TSAs and how transit riders could possibly travel as EDT varies. The total trips generated by or attracted to TSA and the temporal and spatial variations of these metrics across days are used to monitor TSAs, especially transit trips within or between them. The results indicate that transit trips attracted to, and generated by TSA and transit trips between TSAs vary significantly over time and across space. Across the scenarios, the temporal variance tends to be larger as EDT becomes more inelastic. The above results provide useful references for decision-makers to understand better the ranges of transit demand (by TSA) across the space and time when EDT is a variable.},

abstract = {In both the scientific and the professional communities, the need to integrate transport and land use policies to achieve more sustainable mobility patterns is widely recognized. Three challenges to attaining integrated strategies are identified. The first challenge is to find a common language and concepts that stimulate communication between disciplines. The second challenge is to create more explicit links between broader economic, social, and environmental goals and transport policies. The third challenge is to put more emphasis on policy design, the phase in the planning process in which opportunities for policy integration are maximal but which is poorly supported by current transport planning approaches. Accessibility is a concept that can address all three challenges. It relates to features of the transport system (speed, travel costs) as well as the land use system (densities, opportunities) and can be related to wider goals within society (for example, access to jobs). A well-known and wellstudied concept within the scientific literature, accessibility is nonetheless not often used. This paper develops a framework to stimulate the joint design of accessibility-enhancing strategies, and the framework is then tested and developed in cooperation with practitioners in two case studies in the Netherlands.},

This study provides a comprehensive review of the practice of using smart card data for destination estimation. The results show that the land use factor is not discussed in more than three quarters of papers and sensitivity analysis is not applied in two thirds of papers. In addition, the results are not validated in half the relevant studies.

abstract = {Transit service reliability is an important determinant of service quality, which has been mainly studied from the perspective of passengers waiting at stops. Day-to-day variability of travel time also deteriorates service reliability, but is not a well-researched area in the literature partly due to the lack of comprehensive data sets on bus travel times. While this problem is now being addressed through the uptake of global positioning system (GPS)-based tracking systems, methodologies to analyze these data sets are limited. This paper addresses this issue by investigating day-to-day variability in public transport travel time using a GPS data set for a bus route in Melbourne, Australia. It explores the nature and shape of travel time distributions for different departure time windows at different times of the day. Factors causing travel time variability of public transport are also explored using a linear regression analysis. The results show that in narrower departure time windows, travel time distributions are best characterized by normal distributions. For wider departure time windows, peak-hour travel times follow normal distributions, while off-peak travel times follow lognormal distributions. The factors contributing to the variability of travel times are found to be land use, route length, number of traffic signals, number of bus stops, and departure delay relative to the scheduled departure time. Travel time variability is higher in the AM peak and lower in the off-peak. The impact of rainfall on travel time variability is only found significant in the AM peak. While the paper presents new methods for analyzing GPS-based data, there is much scope for expanding knowledge through wider applications to new data sets and using a wider range of explanatory variables. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.},

abstract = {The concept of transit-rich neighborhoods (TRNs) has become a focus of more interest as it relates to rapidly growing and congested communities, and it has received national attention because of its contribution to smart growth in the United States. Although most investment in transit services has been concentrated in denser central cities, where most transit users, including those of low income, reside, the trend toward the decentralization of poverty has become evident in many metropolitan areas and underscored the need to improve suburban transit services. Many studies pertaining to transit ridership have focused on the physical characteristics of stations, their catchment areas, and equity issues for low-income riders, particularly in central cities, without accounting for the evolving socioeconomic characteristics of the neighborhoods being served. To address this issue, this paper categorizes TRNs based on changing socioeconomic and spatial characteristics and uses multiple regression to examine the relationship between types of TRNs and transit ridership in the Atlanta metropolitan area, focusing on the decentralization of poverty. The results show that suburban TRNs became more diverse in terms of income and race between 2000 and 2009, which suggests that investment in commuter rail transit is an important contribution to social and economic equality at the regional level. Furthermore, poverty rates in suburban areas, compared to those in their downtown and inner-city counterpart TRNs, positively influence the percentage of transit ridership. The increased use of suburban transit services suggests the potential presence of increased latent demand, which is further supported by the decentralization of poverty.},

abstract = {New York City Transit's automated fare collection system, known as MetroCard, is an entry-only system that records the serial number of the MetroCard and the time and location (subway turnstile or bus number) of each use. A methodology that estimates station-to-station origin and destination (O-D) trip tables by using this MetroCard information is described. The key is to determine the sequence of trips made throughout a day on each MetroCard. This is accomplished by sorting the MetroCard information by serial number and time and then extracting, for each MetroCard, the sequence of the trips and the station used at the origin of each trip. A set of straightforward algorithms is applied to each set of MetroCard trips to infer a destination station for each origin station. The algorithms are based on two primary assumptions. First, a high percentage of riders return to the destination station of their previous trip to begin their next trip. Second, a high percentage of riders end their last trip of the day at the station where they began their first trip of the day. These assumptions were tested by using travel diary information collected by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. This diary information confirmed that both assumptions are correct for a high percentage (90{\%}) of subway users. The output was further validated by comparing inferred destination totals to station exit counts by time of day and by estimating peak load point passenger volumes by using a trip assignment model. The major applications of this project are to describe travel patterns for service planning and to create O-D trip tables as input to a trip assignment model. The trip assignment model is used to determine passenger volumes on trains at peak load points and other locations by using a subway network coded with existing or modified service. These passenger volumes are used for service planning and scheduling and to quantify travel patterns. This methodology eliminates the need for periodic systemwide O-D surveys that are costly and time-consuming. The new method requires no surveying and eliminates sources of response bias, such as low response rates for certain demographic groups. The MetroCard market share is currently 80{\%} and increasing. MetroCard data are available continuously 365 days a year, which allows O-D data estimation to be repeated for multiple days to improve accuracy or to account for seasonality.},

abstract = {Many planning support tools have recently been developed aimed at measuring and modelling accessibility (Accessibility Instrument or AI). The main difficulty for tool developers is designing an AI that is at the same time technically rigorous and usable in practice. Measuring accessibility is indeed a complex task, and AI outputs are difficult to communicate to target end-users, in particular, because these users are professionals from several disciplines with different languages and areas of expertise, such as urban geographers, spatial planners, transport planners, and budgeting professionals. In addition to this, AI developers seem to have little awareness of the needs of AI end-users, which in turn tend to have limited ability for using these tools. Against this complex background, our research focuses on the viewpoint of AI developers, with two aims: (1) to provide insights into how AI developers perceive their tools and (2) to understand how their perceptions might change after testing their AI with end-users. With this in mind, an analysis of 15 case studies was performed: groups of end-users tested different AI in structured workshops. Before and after the workshops, two questionnaires explored the AI developers' perceptions on the tools and their usability. The paper demonstrates that the workshops with end-users were critical for developers to appreciate the importance of specific characteristics the tool should have, namely practical relevance, flexibility, and ease of use. The study provides evidence that AI developers were prone to change their perceptions about AI after interacting directly with end-users.},

abstract = {This paper considers the implications of so-called ‘big data' for the analysis, modelling and planning of transport systems. The primary conceptual focus is on the needs of the practical context of medium-term planning and decision-making, from which perspective the paper seeks to achieve three goals: (i) to try to identify what is truly ‘special' about big data; (ii) to provoke debate on the future relationship between transport planning and big data; and (iii) to try to identify promising themes for research and application. Differences in the information that can be derived from the data compared to more traditional surveys are discussed, and the respects in which they may impact on the role of models in supporting transport planning and decision-making are identified. It is argued that, over time, changes to the nature of data may lead to significant differences in both modelling approaches and in the expectations placed upon them. Furthermore, it is suggested that the potential widespread availability of data to commercial actors and travellers will affect the performance of the transport systems themselves, which might be expected to have knock-on effects for planning functions. We conclude by proposing a series of research challenges that we believe need to be addressed and warn against adaptations based on minimising change from the status quo.},

abstract = {To mitigate the congestion caused by the ever increasing number of privately owned automobiles, public transit is highly promoted by transportation agencies worldwide. A better understanding of travel patterns and regularity at the "magnitude" level will enable transit authorities to evaluate the services they offer, adjust marketing strategies, retain loyal customers and improve overall transit performance. However, it is fairly challenging to identify travel patterns for individual transit riders in a large dataset. This paper proposes an efficient and effective data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing, China. Transit riders' trip chains are identified based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of their smart card transaction data. The Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm then analyzes the identified trip chains to detect transit riders' historical travel patterns and the K-Means++ clustering algorithm and the rough-set theory are jointly applied to cluster and classify travel pattern regularities. The performance of the rough-set-based algorithm is compared with those of other prevailing classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed rough-set-based algorithm outperforms other commonly used data-mining algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, smart card data have received increasing interest from transport researchers as a new source of data for travel behaviour investigation. Collected by smart card systems, smart card data surpass traditional travel survey data in providing more comprehensive spatial-temporal information about urban public transport-based (UPT) trips. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited fully in terms of extracting and exploring the spatial-temporal dynamics of UPT passenger travel behaviour. To advance previous work in this area, this paper demonstrates a multi-step methodology in order to render more insightful spatial-temporal patterns of UPT passenger travel behaviour. Drawing on the Brisbane, Australia, bus network as the case study, a smart card dataset was first processed in combination with General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to reconstruct travel trajectories of bus passengers at bus stop level of spatial granularity. By applying geographical information system-based (GIS) techniques, this dataset was used to create flow-comaps to visualise the aggregate flow patterns at a network level. The flow-comaps uncovered the major pathways of bus passengers and its variations over a one-day period. The differences within the flow-comaps were also quantified to produce weighted flow-comaps that highlighted the major temporal changes of passenger flow patterns along a number of stop-to-stop linkages of the bus network. The proposed methodology visually unveiled the spatial-temporal travel behaviour dynamics of UPT passengers and, in doing so, showed the potential to contribute to a new evidence base with the capacity to inform local public transport policy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

These disparities reflect both the ability of the public transport system to meet the needs of residents and the locational pros and cons of public service facilities. In this paper, integrated accessibility metrics are used to assess the disparities in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China. This is achieved by dividing the urban space into a multilevel grid that can be easily combined with grid-based population data to facilitate accessibility modeling, calculation, and evaluation. Additionally, an acquisition method for more accurate travel time data in the multimodal public transportation network was developed on the basis of an Internet mapping service. This provides a realistic, multimodal, door-to-door modeling approach that avoids the requirement of building complex traffic networks through Geographic Information System (GIS) software and simplifies road network modeling efforts. The results show that this modeling method can be used to reflect the accessibility disparities in the Nanjing urban space objectively and accurately.},

abstract = {Providing accessibility by public transportation is one of the main concerns in sustainable transportation development. An appropriate accessibility index should not only take transportation and land use into account but also the people who want to attend activities via the transport system. Travel time as the most common variable is used to indicate the role of transportation. A trip with public transport includes different parts: walking from the origin point to the bus stop or from the bus stop to the destination point, waiting for the bus to arrive, and in-vehicle time. These different parts have different weight values for passengers which affect their tendency towards traveling by public transportation. In this paper, a GIS-based multimodal gravity model is developed based on the weighted door to door travel time to compute accessibility by public transportation. Five main distinct urban activities including employment, education, healthcare, shop, recreation opportunities, and services are considered and the accessibility of the target population at the census block level to these destinations through public transportation is computed. In the next step, in order to consider all activities together and report a single unique index, the five computed accessibility indices are integrated into a composite index using a principal component analysis (PCA). The integrated accessibility measure helps to get an insight into the relative distribution of the benefits of public transportation and its interaction with the land use. The proposed method is applied to the City of Isfahan in Iran. The results indicate where places, for each activity and in overall, would benefit from the better land use and public transportation interaction and where regions would suffer from low accessibility level. This work provides a methodological framework as a tool for measuring the performance of public transportation and its interaction with the land use pattern.},

abstract = {Public transportation systems generate economic benefits that can potentially reduce social disparities between populations when such benefits are distributed evenly within a region. However, the achievement of equity in the allocation of public resources is not easy to accomplish for land use and transportation planning agencies. This research seeks to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged areas in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA), Canada, experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other areas over the course of a day. Comparisons are presented in terms of regional accessibility, trends by social decile, spatial distribution of accessibility during the day, and travel time impacts. Findings suggest that residents in socially disadvantaged areas have equitable if not better transit accessibility to jobs than socially advantaged groups, and this is reflected in shorter travel times. However, the degree and impact of this advantage varies over the course of the day. Findings from this research can be of interest to transportation planners, engineers, and policy makers as it highlights deficiencies with current equity assessment practices that do not take into account variation in transit services over a 24-h time period.},

abstract = {Assessing the performance of public transit services has long been an important yet challenging issue for transportation agencies and researchers. Transit service performance measurement reflects a very first step towards an efficient and proactive management, where public transit agencies are increasingly pressured to provide high-quality services in spite of constrained resources. However, the performance evaluation of transit services is complicated by an array of quantitative measures available to assess the goals and the diversity in the goals themselves, which usually include improving operational efficiency and providing equitable access. While much previous work has examined public transit services for achieving optimal operational efficiency and/or access equity separately, the interplay of the two has rarely been investigated to date. This article proposes a new method for evaluating the overall performance of public transit services via a combination of data envelopment analysis (DEA), Geographic Information System (GIS), and multi-objective spatial optimization techniques. The new method is applied to assessing the performance of fixed route bus services operated by the Utah Transit Authorities (UTA) in the Wasatch Front, Utah. Results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively account for operational efficiency and access equity in an integrated framework, providing a more comprehensive assessment for transit service performance.},

abstract = {Metro systems have become one of the most important public transit services in cities. It is important to understand individual metro passengers' spatio-temporal travel patterns. More specifically, for a specific passenger: what are the temporal patterns? what are the spatial patterns? is there any relationship between the temporal and spatial patterns? are the passenger's travel patterns normal or special? Answering all these questions can help to improve metro services, such as evacuation policy making and marketing. Given a set of massive smart card data over a long period, how to effectively and systematically identify and understand the travel patterns of individual passengers in terms of space and time is a very challenging task. This paper proposes an effective data-mining procedure to better understand the travel patterns of individual metro passengers in Shenzhen, a modern and big city in China. First, we investigate the travel patterns in individual level and devise the method to retrieve them based on raw smart card transaction data, then use statistical-based and unsupervised clustering-based methods, to understand the hidden regularities and anomalies of the travel patterns. From a statistical-based point of view, we look into the passenger travel distribution patterns and find out the abnormal passengers based on the empirical knowledge. From unsupervised clustering point of view, we classify passengers in terms of the similarity of their travel patterns. To interpret the group behaviors, we also employ the bus transaction data. Moreover, the abnormal passengers are detected based on the clustering results. At last, we provide case studies and findings to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme},

abstract = {Large-scale urban sensing data, such as vehicle global positioning system (GPS) traces, are emerging as an important data source for urban planning. However, the widespread availability of commercial truck GPS data comes with a large diversity of sources with different operational characteristics. In this context, motivated by addressing ongoing challenges in urban logistics from the perspective of transport geography, we describe an approach to exploring and analyzing a large amount of vehicle GPS data from heterogeneous sources. Our aim is to leverage GPS data to better understand and characterize urban logistics from a broader, city-wide perspective as well as from the perspective of a single corporate logistics system. Using the city of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, Brazil, as an example, we show how such data can be leveraged to improve the operational planning of transport operators and the policymaking strategies of public agencies, especially in cities in developing and emerging economies where other sources of data are not readily available. We build on GPS data from company-specific logistics fleets as well as company-agnostic, mixed-use general vehicle fleets to present novel insights into the spatial distribution of cargo vehicles across the city on different days, the distinct flows and preferred paths of freight traffic, the number of stops per vehicle trip, the distribution of stop times, and the speed patterns. Our proposed approach can easily be transferred and extended to other geographic contexts and other datasets that exhibit structures similar to those used in our case study.},

abstract = {Efficient public transport (PT) networks are vital for well-functioning and sustainable cities. Compared to other modes of transport, PT networks feature inherent systemic complexity due to their schedule-dependence and network organization. Because of this, efficient PT network planning and management calls for advanced modeling and analysis tools. These tools have to take into account how people use PT networks, including factors such as demand, accessibility, trip planning and navigability. From the PT user perspective, the common criteria for planning trips include waiting times to departure, journey durations, and the number of required transfers. However, waiting times and transfers have typically been neglected in PT accessibility studies and related decision-support tools. Here, we tackle this issue by introducing a decision-support framework for PT planners and managers, based on temporal networks methodology. This framework allows for computing pre-journey waiting times, journey durations, and number of required transfers for all Pareto-optimal journeys between any origin–destination pair, at all points in time. We visualize this information as a temporal distance profile, covering any given time interval. Based on such profiles, we define the best-case, mean, and worst-case measures for PT travel time and number of required PT vehicle boardings, and demonstrate their practical utility to PT planning through a series of accessibility case studies. By visualizing the computed measures on a map and studying their relationships by performing an all-to-all analysis between 7463 PT stops in the Helsinki metropolitan region, we show that each of the measures provides a different perspective on accessibility. To pave the way towards more comprehensive understanding of PT accessibility, we provide our methods and full analysis pipeline as free and open source software.},

abstract = {Many large transit systems use automatic fare collection (AFC) systems. Most AFC systems were designed solely for revenue management, but they contain a wealth of customer use data that can be mined to create inputs to operations planning and demand forecasting models for transportation planning. More detailed information than could ever be collected by any travel survey is potentially available if it is assumed that the transactional data can be processed to produce the desired information. Previous work in this field focused primarily on rail transit, since boardings at fixed stations are easier to locate than boardings of buses, which move around. This paper presents a case study for the Metropolitan Transit Authority's New York City Transit, a transit system in which a rider swipes a fare card only to enter a station or board a bus. This is the first work to include trips by all transit modes in a system that records the transaction only on rider entry, which is significantly more challenging because all the alighting locations need to be inferred and the bus boarding locations need to be estimated. No location information (from automated vehicle location technology or a Global Positioning System) was available for buses. Software that processes the 7 million-plus daily transactions and that creates a data set of linked transit trips was created. The data set can then be analyzed by using geographic information systembased query software to create reports, maps, origin-destination matrices, load profiles, and new data sets. Subway journeys are assigned by using a schedule-based shortest-path algorithm.},

In this model, both the measurement of objective physical parameters and subjective questionnaire survey were conducted to gather the practical environment date, as well as to distribute questionnaires on board city buses during the same trips. By comparing the subjective views of bus passengers to objective physical parameters, a combined bus comfort model was established. This model helps to calculate the concrete value of passengers' perceived bus comfort. An effective approach integrated the comfort model, measuring instrument and the driver monitor could greatly improve the bus service quality.},

Part of this quest involves measuring the great array of regular patterns within such data and explaining these relative to less regular patterns which have often been treated in the past as noise. Here we use a simple method called DBSCAN to identify clusters of travel events asso-ciated with particular individuals whose behaviour over space and time is captured by smart card data. Our dataset is a sequence of three months of data recording when and where individual travellers start and end rail and bus travel in Greater London. This dataset contains some 640 million transactions during the period of analysis we have chosen and it enables us to begin a search for regularities at the most basic level. We first define measures of regularity in terms of the proportions of events associated with temporal, modal (rail and bus), and service regularity clusters, revealing that the frequency distri-butions of these clusters follow skewed distributions with different means and variances. The analysis then continues to examine how regularity relative to irregular travel across space, demonstrating high regularities in the origins of trips in the suburbs contrasted with high regularities in the destinations in central London. This analysis sets the agenda for future research into how we capture and measure the differences between regular and irregular travel which we discuss by way of conclusion.},

abstract = {Crowding discomfort is an external cost of public transport trips imposed on fellow passengers that has to be measured in order to derive optimal supply-side decisions. This paper presents a comprehensive method to estimate the user cost of crowding in terms of the equivalent travel time loss, in a revealed preference route choice framework. Using automated demand and train location data we control for fluctuations in crowding conditions on the entire length of a metro journey, including variations in the density of standing passengers and the probability of finding a seat. The estimated standing penalty is 26.5{\%} of the uncrowded value of in-vehicle travel time. An additional passenger per square metre on average adds 11.9{\%} to the travel time multiplier. These results are in line with earlier revealed preference values, and suggest that stated choice methods may overestimate the user cost of crowding. As a side-product, and an important input of the route choice analysis, we derive a novel passenger-to-train assignment method to recover the daily crowding and standing probability pattern in the metro network.},

This paper attempts to utilize the smart card data as an input for large-scale activity based public transport simulation for analyzing travel behavior pertaining to transit users, using an open source agent-based transport simulation package, MATSim. Transit vehicles are optimized based on input demand generated by smart card and a high temporal resolution of waiting time and its components at different stations is extracted which is very important in managing the frequency and headway of transit vehicles. Since no card swipe is needed for transfers within subway system in Seoul, the data is not readily available to detect frequent transfer locations. However, after validating the boarding and alighting volumes at different stations, a methodology is presented to calculate within subway transfer volumes at different stations. We suggest that by improving the statistical analysis and utilizing advanced data mining techniques, smart cards can effectively generate the microsimulation travel demand models.},

In particular, we show how fare collection data can be used to identify behavioural differences between passengers: we thus advocate for a personalised approach to delivering transport related information to travellers. To demonstrate the potential for personalisation we compute trip time estimates that more accurately reflect the travel habits of each passenger. We propose a number of algorithms for personalised trip time estimations, and empirically demonstrate that these approaches outperform both a non-personalised baseline computed from the data, as well as published travel times as currently offered by the transport authority. Furthermore, we show how to easily scale the system by pre-clustering travellers. We close by outlining the wide variety of applications and services that may be fuelled by fare collection data. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Smart card data are increasingly used for transit network planning, passengers' behaviour analysis and network demand forecasting. Public transport origin-destination (O-D) estimation is a significant product of processing smart card data. In recent years, various O-D estimation methods using the trip-chaining approach have attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. However, the validity of these estimation methods has not been extensively investigated. This is mainly because these datasets usually lack data about passengers' alighting, as passengers are often required to tap their smart cards only when boarding a public transport service. Thus, this paper has two main objectives. First, the paper reports on the implementation and validation of the existing O-D estimation method using the unique smart card dataset of the South-East Queensland public transport network which includes data on both boarding stops and alighting stops. Second, the paper improves the O-D estimation algorithm and empirically examines these improvements, relying on this unique dataset. The evaluation of the last destination assumption of the trip-chaining method shows a significant negative impact on the matching results of the differences between actual boarding/alighting times and the public transport schedules. The proposed changes to the algorithm improve the average distance between the actual and estimated alighting stops, as this distance is reduced from 806 m using the original algorithm to 530 m after applying the suggested improvements.},

abstract = {This study assesses the impact of proximity to light rail transit stations on residential property values in Buffalo, New York, where light rail has been in service for 20 years, but population is declining and ridership is decreasing. Hedonic models are constructed of assessed value for residential properties within half a mile of 14 light rail stations and independent variables are included that describe property characteristics, neighbourhood characteristics and locational amenities. The model suggests that, for homes located in the study area, every foot closer to a light rail station increases average property values by {\$}2.31 (using geographical straight-line distance) and {\$}0.99 (using network distance). Consequently, a home located within one-quarter of a mile radius of a light rail station can earn a premium of {\$}1300-3000, or 2-5 per cent of the city's median home value. Model results further suggest that three independent variables-the number of bathrooms, size of the parcel and location on the East side or West side of Buffalo-are more influential than rail proximity in predicting property values. Individual regression models for each of the light rail system's 14 stations suggest that effects are not felt evenly throughout the system. Proximity effects are positive in high-income station areas and negative in low-income station areas. An analysis of the actual walking distance to stations (along the street network) versus the perceived proximity to stations (measured by straight-line distance) reveals that the results are statistically more significant in the network distance than the straight-line distance model, but the effects are greater in the straight-line distance model, which suggests that apparent proximity to rail stations is an added locational advantage compared with physical walking distance to the station.},

The first is the constraints-oriented approach, best imple- mented by Hagerstrand's space-time prisms. The second perspective follows a spatial interaction framework and derives “attraction-accessibility measures” that compare destinations' attractiveness with the travel costs required. A third approach measures the benefit provided to individuals by the transportation J land-use system. This paper reconciles the three complementa y approaches by deriving space-time accessibility and benefit measures that are consistent with the rigorous Weibull axiomatic framework for accessibility measures. This research also develops computational procedures for calculating these measures within network structures. This provides realistic accessibility measures that re- flect the locations, distances, and travel velocities allowed by an urban transpor- tation network. Since their computational burdens are reasonable, they can be applied at the urban scale using a GIs.},

The representation of these models is especially important in urban areas, in which the under-standing of patterns of energy production and demand is key for an efficient city planning. Location Based Services (LBS) provide a valuable addition towards the analysis and visualization of those data sets as the user can explore the output of different models and simulations in the real environment at the location of interest. Towards this aim, the present research explores mobile alternatives to the visual analysis of temporal data series and 3D building models. Based on the fields of numerical simulation, GIS and computer graphics, this work presents a novel mobile service that allows exploring urban models at different Level of Details (LoDs) using well-known standards such as CityGML. Ultimately, the project enables researchers, city planners and technicians to explore urban energy datasets in an interactive and immersive manner as Virtual Globes, Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. Using models of the city of Karlsruhe, the final service has been implemented and tested on the iOS platform providing an empirical insight on the performance of the system. In addition, this research provides a holistic approach by developing one application that is capable of seamlessly change the visualization mode.},

These systems provide a continuous flow of data on transactions made on networks; hence it helps to better understand customer (card) travel behavior, and the data can also be used to characterize and model general ridership, customer loyalty, and network performance indicators. But many systems only record the entrance (" tap-in ") transaction in the system. There is a need to estimate the exit (" tap-out ") location to have origin-destination trip information. In this paper, we use tap-in/tap-out smart card data from Brisbane, Australia, to calibrate and validate a trip destination estimation algorithm developed for Canadian data. Results show that the algorithm has an accuracy of 79{\%} within an acceptable distance of 400 m. The proposed calibration method helped to solve 1.4{\%} more destinations.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of boarding/alighting activities and its impact on bus dwell times is crucial to improving bus service levels. However, research is limited as conventional data collection methods are both time and labour intensive. In this paper, we present the first use of smart card data to study passenger boarding/alighting behaviour and its impact on bus dwell time. Given the nature of these data, we focus on passenger activity time and do not account for the time necessary to open and close doors. We study single decker, double decker and articulated buses and identify the specific effects of floor/entrance type, number of activities and occupancy on both boarding and alighting dynamics. A linear relationship between average boarding and alighting times and their respective standard deviations is also found, whereas the variability of boarding and alighting time decreases with the number of passengers boarding and alighting. After observing the cumulative boarding/alighting processes under different occupancy conditions, we propose a new model to estimate passenger activity time, by introducing critical occupancy - a parameter incorporating the friction between boarding/alighting and on-board passengers. We conduct regression analyses with the proposed and another popular model for simultaneous boarding/alighting processes, finding that the critical occupancy plays a significant role in determining the regime of boarding and alighting processes and the overall activity time. Our results provide potential implications for practice and policy, such as identifying optimal vehicle type for a particular route and modelling transit service reliability.},

abstract = {The smart cards conquered a serious space in the traffic in the past years. The cards are used like an automatic fare collection system by the different public transport companies. The fare collection is easier, faster and last but not least more efficient with this method. However the generated data are utilizable for other aims apart from the original aim. The origin-destination matrix plays a key role in a transport company's life. We may adapt to the travel demands efficiently in the knowledge of the matrix. Thanks to the proper service the passengers will be satisfied, and they use the service with pleasure. The additional benefit, that the unnecessary capacities can be forced back in the knowledge of the demand, and thereby the expenses of the service provider's decrease. The origin-destination matrix was able to create only with classical counting and interview methods till now. Their disadvantage, that the production consumes considerable workforce and time with a method like this, and hereby the costs are higher. The counting concern to a given time only and the sampling proportion compared to the number of travels of the year is quite slight. Because of that the distortion effect is considerable, the matrix cannot reflect the effects of an intervention. These effects get into the system only after the next counting. The penetration of the smart cards increases, the card user passengers' number increases continuously. Thanks to that, not only the cost efficiency of the fare collection is growing, but at the same time the statistical sample size too. If more passengers from young persons to older ones accept the usage of the cards, we may receive more accurate picture about the transportation network. If the fare collection system was built up somewhere, the origin-destination matrix can be manufactured with lower expenses, and because of the continuous usage the matrix will be current always, the changes become traceable. We may know the demands in all the moments, the origin-destination matrix may change dynamically in function of the weather, time of the day, season and so on. The check-out data can be manufactured from exclusively check in data with different algorithms. The passenger's boarding and alighting places become known on the given route. Linking the sections belonging to a single trip and defining the target point, the origin destination matrix can be developed.},

abstract = {Transport policy in Britain is under the influence of a 'new realism'. This paper explores policy instruments which are central to the new approach-'getting the price right' and influencing travel patterns through land use planning. It suggests that the concept of the 'right' price is problematic, that land use measures are necessary but not sufficient and that neither pricing nor planning policies are likely, in isolation, to have sufficient effect across the range of environmental impacts of transport. A sustainable transport policy means maximising accessibility within environmental constraints and must be achieved by means of a co-ordinated policy package. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

Pela minha percep{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, a pol{\'{i}}tica de predict and prevente requer a determina{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de uma miss{\~{a}}o e objetivo sobre o que se quer da cidade e dos cidad{\~{a}}os, enquanto o oposto {\'{e}} visto na pol{\'{i}}tica de predict and provide.

Predict and Provide
Consiste na proje{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da demanda, estabelecimento das necessidade e provis{\~{a}}o da infraestrutura necess{\'{a}}ria.

Aqui, a autora usou muito de um exemplo espec{\'{i}}fico para criticar a pol{\'{i}}tica.

Eu n{\~{a}}o diria que o problema est{\'{a}} na pol{\'{i}}tica, e sim da forma como ela {\'{e}} utilizada!
Por exemplo: um caso cl{\'{a}}ssico seria prever a quantidade de ve{\'{i}}culos em certa via e construir a infraestrutura necess{\'{a}}ria para acomodar essa demanda. Ser{\'{a}} que {\'{e}} s{\'{o}} esse o caso que a autora quis referenciar?

The price is right
Aqui, a principal premissa {\'{e}} que o custo decorrido do transporte (individual, principalmente) n{\~{a}}o {\'{e}} pago completamente pelo consumidor.
E, para mitigar isso, {\'{e}} imposto um custo superior ao consumidor.
Por{\'{e}}m, acredito que o objetivo n{\~{a}}o seja que o consumidor pague o pre{\c{c}}o "real" que consome, e sim que o estabelecimento do pre{\c{c}}o "real" para o consumidor desestimule ele a n{\~{a}}o utilizar mais aquele modo de transporte.},

abstract = {The accessibility impacts of transport projects ex-post implementation are generally evaluated using cumulative opportunity measures based on a single travel time threshold. Fewer studies have explored how accessibility appraisal of transport plans can be used to evaluate policy scenarios and their impacts for different social groups or examined whether the results of project appraisals are sensitive to the time threshold of choice. This paper analyzes how different scenarios of full and partial implementation of the TransBrasil BRT project in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) will likely impact the number of jobs accessible to the population of different income levels. The analysis is conducted under various travel time thresholds of 30, 60, 90 and 120 min to test whether the results are sensitive to the boundary effect of the modifiable temporal unit problem (MTUP). Compared to a partial operation scenario, the full implementation of TransBrasil that extends this corridor into the city center would lead to higher accessibility gains due to network effects of connecting this BRT to other transport modes. Nonetheless, the size of the accessibility impacts of the proposed BRT as well as its distribution across income classes would significantly change depending on the time threshold chosen for the accessibility analysis. Considering cut-off times of 30 or 60 min, both scenarios of TransBrasil would lead to higher accessibility impacts in general and particularly for low-income groups, moving Rio towards a more equitable transportation system. However, under longer thresholds of 90 and 120 min, an evaluation of this project would find much smaller accessibility gains more evenly distributed by income levels. The paper highlights how time threshold choice in cumulative opportunity measures can have important but overlooked implications for policy evaluation and it calls for further research on the MTUP in future transport and mobility studies.},

abstract = {The benefits and burdens of public transit service changes can be quantified using many different metrics. In the United States, the Federal Transit Administration requires transit agencies to assess the equity of proposed service changes using the demographic shares of affected riders. The purpose of the work presented here is to inform the development of more robust transit equity analyses than are currently conducted by integrating measures of accessibility – the ease with destinations can be reached – into FTA-required analyses. The measures are calculated using publicly available data, including the US Census Bureau's Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics dataset and transit route and schedule information in the General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format. The results demonstrate that relying on a single measure (e.g. population shares or accessibility) to associate a route with a particular demographic group is likely to be deficient. Previous academic work on accessibility has not translated well to practice in part because the calculation of accessibility relied upon regional travel demand model outputs that were difficult to obtain. This work thus fills an important gap in the literature and practice by tying advances in the academic literature to FTA-mandated analysis with publicly available data.},

abstract = {The availability of smart card data from public transport travelling the last decades allows analyzing current and predicting future public transport usage. Public transport models are commonly applied to predict ridership due to structural network changes, using a calibrated parameter set. Predicting the impact of planned disturbances, like temporary track closures, on public transport ridership is however an unexplored area. In the Netherlands, this area becomes increasingly important, given the many track closures operators are confronted with the last and upcoming years. We investigated the passenger impact of four planned disturbances on the public transport network of The Hague, the Netherlands, by comparing predicted and realized public transport ridership using smart card data. A three-step search procedure is applied to find a parameter set resulting in higher prediction accuracy. We found that in-vehicle time in rail-replacing bus services is perceived ≈1.1 times more negatively compared to in-vehicle time perception in the initial tram line. Waiting time for temporary rail-replacement bus services is found to be perceived ≈1.3 times higher, compared to waiting time perception for regular tram and bus services. Besides, passengers do not seem to perceive the theoretical benefit of the usually higher frequency of rail-replacement bus services compared to the frequency of the replaced tram line. For the different case studies, the new parameter set results in 3{\%} up to 13{\%} higher prediction accuracy compared to the default parameter set. It supports public transport operators to better predict the required supply of rail-replacement services and to predict the impact on their revenues.},

It proposes new spatial validation features to increase the accuracy of destination inference results and to verify key assumptions present in previous origin–destination estimation literature. The methodology applies to entry-only system configurations combined with distance-based fare structures, and it aims to enhance raw AFC system data with the destination of individual journeys. This paper describes an algorithm developed to implement the methodology and the results from its application to bus service data from Porto. The data relate to an AFC system integrated with an automatic vehicle location system that records a transaction for each passenger boarding a bus, containing attributes regarding the route, the vehicle, and the travel card used, along with the time and the location where the journey began. Some of these are recorded for the purpose of allowing onboard ticket inspection but additionally enable innovative spatial validation features introduced by the methodology. The results led to the conclusion that the methodology is effective for estimating journey destinations at the disaggregate level and identifies false positives reliably.},

abstract = {Urban rail transit could affect urban development in multiple aspects. Using Singapore as an example, we investigate the impact of planners' and developers' decisions on the density distribution of high-income households in areas around Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) stations and how these households respond to better access to urban rail transit systems. We find that the maximum density permitted by the master plan is only marginally correlated with the distances to MRT stations. Instead, the average unit size tends to be smaller, and the share of small-sized units tends to be higher in new private projects that are close to MRT stations after the new lines are in operation. This indicates that developers, who act mainly in response to the market, intentionally place more housing units in developments closer to MRT stations. Consequently, more upper- and upper-middle-class households that can afford private housing are accommodated in areas with greater accessibility to MRT. By comparing two household travel surveys before and after the opening of the Circle Line, we find that MRT did not change household demographics much in the station area, but there was an evident change in the mode share of trips made by the surveyed households, embodied by lower levels of car dependence and more reliance on MRT.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, smart card data have received increasing interest from transport researchers as a new source of data for travel behaviour investigation. Collected by smart card systems, smart card data surpass traditional travel survey data in providing more comprehensive spatial-temporal information about urban public transport-based (UPT) trips. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited fully in terms of extracting and exploring the spatial-temporal dynamics of UPT passenger travel behaviour. To advance previous work in this area, this paper demonstrates a multi-step methodology in order to render more insightful spatial-temporal patterns of UPT passenger travel behaviour. Drawing on the Brisbane, Australia, bus network as the case study, a smart card dataset was first processed in combination with General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to reconstruct travel trajectories of bus passengers at bus stop level of spatial granularity. By applying geographical information system-based (GIS) techniques, this dataset was used to create flow-comaps to visualise the aggregate flow patterns at a network level. The flow-comaps uncovered the major pathways of bus passengers and its variations over a one-day period. The differences within the flow-comaps were also quantified to produce weighted flow-comaps that highlighted the major temporal changes of passenger flow patterns along a number of stop-to-stop linkages of the bus network. The proposed methodology visually unveiled the spatial-temporal travel behaviour dynamics of UPT passengers and, in doing so, showed the potential to contribute to a new evidence base with the capacity to inform local public transport policy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper uses transit smartcards from travelers in Beijing retained over a 7-y period to track boarding and alighting stations, which are associated with home and work location. This allows us to track who moves and who remains at their homes and workplaces. Therefore, this paper provides a longitudinal study of job and housing dynamics with group conceptualization and characterization. This paper identifies four mobility groups and then infers their socioeconomic profiles. How these groups trade off housing expenditure and travel time budget is examined.Residential locations, the jobs–housing relationship, and commuting patterns are key elements to understand urban spatial structure and how city dwellers live. Their successive interaction is important for various fields including urban planning, transport, intraurban migration studies, and social science. However, understanding of the long-term trajectories of workplace and home location, and the resulting commuting patterns, is still limited due to lack of year-to-year data tracking individual behavior. With a 7-y transit smartcard dataset, this paper traces individual trajectories of residences and workplaces. Based on in-metro travel times before and after job and/or home moves, we find that 45 min is an inflection point where the behavioral preference changes. Commuters whose travel time exceeds the point prefer to shorten commutes via moves, while others with shorter commutes tend to increase travel time for better jobs and/or residences. Moreover, we capture four mobility groups: home mover, job hopper, job-and-residence switcher, and stayer. This paper studies how these groups trade off travel time and housing expenditure with their job and housing patterns. Stayers with high job and housing stability tend to be home (apartment unit) owners subject to middle- to high-income groups. Home movers work at places similar to stayers, while they may upgrade from tenancy to ownership. Switchers increase commute time as well as housing expenditure via job and home moves, as they pay for better residences and work farther from home. Job hoppers mainly reside in the suburbs, suffer from long commutes, change jobs frequently, and are likely to be low-income migrants.},

abstract = {A high-quality Origin-Destination (OD) matrix is a fundamental prerequisite for any serious transport system analysis. However, it is not always easy to obtain it because OD surveys are expensive and difficult to implement. This is particularly relevant in large cities with congested networks, where detailed zonification and time disaggregation require large sample sizes and complicated survey methods. Therefore, the incorporation of information technology in some public transport systems around the world is an excellent opportunity for passive data collection. In this paper, we present a methodology for estimating a public transport OD matrix from smartcard and GPS data for Santiago, Chile. The proposed method is applied to two 1-week datasets obtained for different time periods. From the data available, we obtain detailed information about the time and position of boarding public transportation and generate an estimation of time and position of alighting for over 80{\%} of the boarding transactions. The results are available at any desired time-space disaggregation. After some post-processing and after incorporating expansion factors to account for unobserved trips, we build public transport OD matrices. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the concerns that has aroused much scholarly attention in transport geography lately is the extent to which public transport provision enables the less privileged population segments, especially those without privately owned motorized vehicles, to participate in activities that are deemed normal within the society they live in. This study contributes to this line of inquiry by proposing a methodology for identifying public transit gaps, a mismatch between the socially driven demand for transit and the supply provided by transit agencies. The methodology draws on the latest accomplishments in the field of modeling time-continuous, schedule-based public transport accessibility. Accessibility levels to key destinations are calculated at regular time intervals, and synoptic metrics of these levels over various peak and off-peak time windows are computed for weekdays and weekends. As a result, a temporally reliable picture of accessibility by public transport is constructed. The obtained index of public transport provision is compared to a public transport needs index based on the spatial distribution of various socio-demographics, in order to highlight spatial mismatches between these two indices. The study area consists of Flanders, which is the northern, Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. The results indicate that mainly suburban areas are characterized by high public transport gaps. Due to the time-variability of public transport frequencies, these gaps differ over time.},

abstract = {Entry-only Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) systems are widely used in urban transports. Its main advantages include easy usability by passengers, improvement of the efficiency of revenue management, adequacy to integrate inter-modality approaches, easy cooperation between operators, systematic data collection and gathering tools, contributing to improve the planning process. This work starts with the literature review on applications of the Trip-Chaining Method (TCM) to the estimation of Origin-Destination (OD) matrices using entry-only AFC data. The main contribution of this study is to provide an OD matrix for the city of Porto, allowing to improve the quality of its public transport system. The paper reports the implementation of the TCM to estimate the alighting locations at the disaggregated level in the case study of Porto. The main assumptions adopted are: passengers start the next journey stage at or near the alighting location of their previous trip, passengers end the last trip of the day at the boarding location of the first trip of the day, passengers can only alight in the sequence of stops not yet traveled by the route / direction they boarded, passengers have a maximum interchange distance, above which the destination of that journey stage is not inferred.},

abstract = {New York City Transit's automated fare collection system, known as MetroCard, is an entry-only system that records the serial number of the MetroCard and the time and location (subway turnstile or bus number) of each use. A methodology that estimates station-to-station origin and destination (O-D) trip tables by using this MetroCard information is described. The key is to determine the sequence of trips made throughout a day on each MetroCard. This is accomplished by sorting the MetroCard information by serial number and time and then extracting, for each MetroCard, the sequence of the trips and the station used at the origin of each trip. A set of straightforward algorithms is applied to each set of MetroCard trips to infer a destination station for each origin station. The algorithms are based on two primary assumptions. First, a high percentage of riders return to the destination station of their previous trip to begin their next trip. Second, a high percentage of riders end their last trip of the day at the station where they began their first trip of the day. These assumptions were tested by using travel diary information collected by the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council. This diary information confirmed that both assumptions are correct for a high percentage (90{\%}) of subway users. The output was further validated by comparing inferred destination totals to station exit counts by time of day and by estimating peak load point passenger volumes by using a trip assignment model. The major applications of this project are to describe travel patterns for service planning and to create O-D trip tables as input to a trip assignment model. The trip assignment model is used to determine passenger volumes on trains at peak load points and other locations by using a subway network coded with existing or modified service. These passenger volumes are used for service planning and scheduling and to quantify travel patterns. This methodology eliminates the need for periodic systemwide O-D surveys that are costly and time-consuming. The new method requires no surveying and eliminates sources of response bias, such as low response rates for certain demographic groups. The MetroCard market share is currently 80{\%} and increasing. MetroCard data are available continuously 365 days a year, which allows O-D data estimation to be repeated for multiple days to improve accuracy or to account for seasonality.},

abstract = {Transportation systems exist to improve individual accessibility. However, emerging applications of GIS in transportation (GIS-T) and intelligent transportation system (ITS) focus on throughput (the amount of system flow) rather than accessibility. Throughput is related but not equivalent to accessibility. Sensitive transportation planning requires rigorous, realistic and tractable accessibility measures. This paper reports on the development of GIS software that implement space-time accessibility measures (STAMs). The STAMs reflect the benefits that individuals receive from the transportation system. They are easily interpreted, particularly with respect to changes in accessibility. The STAMs also consider the locations and travel velocities dictated by the transportation system as well as individuals' daily activity schedules. Tractable computational procedures allow calculation of the STAMs for detailed, urban-scale transportation networks. A prototype ArcInfo{\textregistered}-linked software system that runs on Windows NT{\textregistered} or Sun Solaris{\textregistered} platform implements the STAMs with user-friendly interfaces and project management tools.},

abstract = {Abstract: Knowing the mobility patterns of citizens using public transportation is an important issue for modern smart cities. Mobility information is crucial for designing and planning an urban transportation system able to provide good service to citizens. We address two relevant problems related to public transportation systems: the analysis of mobility patterns of passengers and the relocation of bus stops in an urban area. For the first problem, a big-data approach is applied to process large volume one space of information. Several relevant metrics are computed and analyzed to characterize the mobility patterns using data from the public transportation system on Montevideo, Uruguay. We obtain user demand and origin-destination matrices by analyzing the tickets sale information and the buses locations. A distributed implementation is proposed, reaching significant execution time improvements (speedup up to 17.10 when using 24 computing resources). For the second problem, a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm is proposed to relocate bus stops in order to improve the quality of service by minimizing the travel time and bus operational costs. The algorithm is evaluated over instances of the problem generated with real data from the year 2015. The experimental results show that the algorithm is able to obtain improvements of up to 16.7 and 33.9{\%} in time and cost respectively, compared to space situation in the year 2015. {\textcopyright} 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.},

abstract = {Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS) have become an important tool for public transport planners, as improvements in the perceived quality of certain service attributes can lead to greater use of public transport and lower traffic pollution. The literature shows that the importance of quality attributes has until now been estimated indirectly, as they are derived from the Customer Satisfaction Index using various different and complex techniques. Little work has been dedicated to its direct estimation (stated importance) by designing ad-hoc surveys, an approach that represents a considerable reduction in the length of the questionnaire. This paper contributes to the limited existing literature by developing a survey technique based on hierarchy processes to estimate the stated importance of quality attributes, and compares the results with the derived importance obtained using conventional surveys with the same sample. The added value of this research is that it provides the first comparison between two quality survey methods using the same real case study in Madrid (Spain). The results achieved using this pioneer survey method (293 valid questionnaires) were validated using conventional face-to-face surveys (520 valid questionnaires). Factorial analysis, multiple regression analysis and Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) models were applied to the conventional survey sample to analyse and derive the importance of the attributes. The results clearly show that, after a few teething troubles, the stated importance of quality attributes can be estimated directly, thus providing transport management companies with a simple and useful tool to implement in their Customer Satisfaction Surveys (CSS), and narrowing the gap between practitioners' needs and scientific research.},

abstract = {Although public transportation is considered effective at reducing the external cost of driving private vehicles, many urbanites do not use public transportation. This study develops measures employing accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity for an entire public transportation service chain as indicators for evaluating public transport services, prioritizes underperforming scenarios from the perspective of urban travelers, and derives various market segmentation strategies that consider different socio-demographic characteristics. A conceptual model is set up herein to assess these latent constructs that describe unobservable and immeasurable characteristics. As a Likert ordinal scale can generate misleading statistical inferences, the Rasch model is used to eliminate bias generated by an ordinal scale when measuring these three latent constructs separately. The Rasch model compares person parameters with item parameters, which are then subjected to logarithmic transformation along a logit scale so as to recognize specific difficulties of service scenarios that cannot be easily eliminated by certain urban travelers. The multidimensional Rasch model also measures the perceptions of urban travelers in terms of the interactions between accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity of this public transportation system. While comparing urban travelers of two large cities in Taiwan, Taipei and Kaohsiung, the empirical results demonstrate that perceived accessibility, mobility, and seamless connectivity differ based on travelers' age, frequency of weekly sports activities, and environmental awareness. This paper also advances appropriate improvement strategies and provides policy suggestions for urban planners, public transportation service operation agencies, and policy makers when they seek to create user-friendly public transportation services. The proposed approach can be generalized in other cities by considering their local context uniqueness and further evaluating their public transport services.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to deal with traffic Origin Destination (OD) matrix estimation starting from the measurements of flow on road network links. It proposes a different approach from published articles to date, by applying multilayer feed-forward neural networks. Since the relationship between link flow and the related OD matrix is continuous, it is possible to use the well known approximation property of Neural Network models. The method is proposed for a real-time correction of the OD matrix. Two application scenarios were developed: a trial network and an actual rural network were both simulated by a micro-simulator that assigns known OD matrices. A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique was used to reduce the amount of variables and to achieve improved significance for input data. The estimated error was relatively low and, as opposed to analytical approaches, the processing time was almost in real time, making this approach suitable for applications in dynamic traffic management. Comparisons with results obtained by an OD estimation commercial program show better performance in the NN approach both as regards error and computing time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.},

Measuring urban structures is essential for supporting an evidence-based spatial planning policy. The objective of this study is to examine how the spatial-temporal distribution of public transport passenger flow could be used to reveal urban structure dynamics. A methodology to identify and classify centres based on mobility data was applied to Metropolitan Stockholm in Sweden using multi-modal public transport passenger flows. Stockholm is known for its long-term monocentric planning with a dominant central core and radial public transport system. Strategic nodes along its radial public transport system have been a focus for development of sub-centres. Although the regional planning policy embraces a shift towards a polycentric planning policy, the results indicate that this has not been realized insofar.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of public transit smart card data has enabled several studies to focus on identifying passengers with similar spatial and/or temporal trip characteristics. However, this paper goes one step further by investigating the relationship between passengers' spatial and temporal characteristics. For the first time, this paper investigates the correlation of the spatial similarity with the temporal similarity between public transit passengers by developing spatial similarity and temporal similarity measures for the public transit network with a novel passenger-based perspective. The perspective considers the passengers as agents who can make multiple trips in the network. The spatial similarity measure takes into account direction as well as the distance between the trips of the passengers. The temporal similarity measure considers both the boarding and alighting time in a continuous linear space. The spatial-temporal similarity correlation between passengers is analysed using histograms, Pearson correlation coefficients, and hexagonal binning. Also, relations between the spatial and temporal similarity values with the trip time and length are examined. The proposed methodology is implemented for four-day smart card data including 80,000 passengers in Brisbane, Australia. The results show a nonlinear spatial-temporal similarity correlation among the passengers.},

The paper elaborates on the methodology of the replication including data cleaning, filtering, processing and converting the collected data to meaningful information such as bus journey trajectories and metro system timetable. Thereafter, actualised passenger trip chains are directly assigned to the replicated public transport supply. The resulting replication covers almost 96{\%} of trips made in public transport in Singapore. It provides solid quantitative information on several aspects to support decision making, including precise temporal and spatial travel demand analysis, transfer pattern analysis, traffic condition investigation and bus utilisation analysis.},

@article{Quiroga1998,
abstract = {The paper describes a new methodology for performing travel time studies using global positioning system (GPS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies. It documents the data collection, data reduction, and data reporting procedures, as well as analyses that illustrate the capabilities of the GPS/GIS methodology. The data collection procedure uses GPS receivers to automatically collect time, local coordinates, and speed at regular sampling periods, for example every one second. The data reduction procedure filters and aggregates GPS data to compute travel time and speed along highway segments. The data reporting procedure uses a GIS-based management information system to define queries, tabular reports, and color coded maps to document travel time data along these highway segments. These procedures have been implemented in three metropolitan areas in Louisiana: Baton Rouge, Shreveport, and New Orleans. In these cities, more than 180 000 segment travel time and speed records were derived between 1995 and 1996 from nearly three million GPS data points collected on 30 000 miles of travel time runs along 300 miles of urban highways. The three analyses included in the paper to assist in the process of understanding the GPS/GIS methodology are the following: segment lengths, sampling rates, and central tendency. The segment length analysis examines the effect of using different highway segment lengths and shows that relatively short segments (0.2-0.5 miles long) are needed to detect localized traffic effects. These traffic disturbances become visible only when segment lengths are at most half the length of the associated disturbance. This means that traditional link-based segments, which are typically longer than 0.5 miles, are not sufficient to characterize localized effects properly. The sampling rate analysis addresses the effect of collecting GPS data at different sampling periods and shows that for a segment to have GPS data associated with it, the GPS sampling period should be smaller than half the shortest travel time associated with the segment. The analysis also shows a tradeoff between sampling rates and segment speed reliability, and emphasizes the need for even shorter GPS sampling periods (1-2s) in order to minimize errors in the computation of segment speeds. The central tendency analysis compares harmonic mean speeds and median speeds and shows that median speeds are more robust estimators of central tendency than harmonic mean speeds.},

To estimate OD matrices while protecting privacy, this study uses aggregated data of mobile phone traces to estimate work-related trips. The proposed approach is a sequential updater based on the maximum entropy principle. Trip production and attraction are firstly calculated by a non-linear programming problem followed by a matrix fitting problem to distribute trips to each OD pair. Numerical study shows that updated values are much closer to the synthesize real values than the referred ones. The case study in Tokyo further demonstrates that the proposed updating approach can track the change of travel pattern.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, a number of techniques have been developed to estimate public transport Origin- 4 Destination (O-D) matrices using smart card fare data. Because of a lack of information regarding the alighting stop for a trip, different walking distance and allowable transfer time assumptions have been applied in the past. Such assumptions have the potential to significantly affect the accuracy level of the estimated O-D matrices. There is little evidence of the accuracy level of O-D estimation methods using smart card fare data. The unique smart card fare data from Brisbane, Queensland, gives the opportunity to assess previous methods and their assumptions. This paper investigates the use of South East Queensland (SEQ) data to study the effect of different assumptions on the estimated O-D matrices and provides sensitivity analysis for different parameters. In addition, an algorithm for generating an O-D matrix based on individual user transactions (trip-legs) is proposed here. As a result, about 85{\%} of the transfer time was found to be non-walking time (wait and short activity time). More than 90{\%} of passengers walk less than 10 minutes to transfer between alighting and the next boarding stop. This represents about 10{\%} of the allowable transfer time. The change in the assumed allowable transfer time, from 15 to 90 minutes, had a minor effect on the estimated O-D matrices. Within the same day, it has been found that most passengers return to within a 400m of their first origin.},

abstract = {Space-time accessibility measures have received much attention in recent years due to their sensitivity to differences in individual ability to participate in activities in space and time. Despite the conceptual attractiveness and robustness of space-time measures, only few attempts have been made to operationalize them to date. Research that seeks to improve space-time accessibility measures is still sorely needed. This study seeks to enhance space-time accessibility measures through developing a new operational method and GIS-based algorithm that better represents the space-time characteristics of urban opportunities (e.g. their geograph- ical distribution and opening hours) and human activity-travel behavior (e.g. delay times, minimum activity participation time, and maximum travel time threshold). The proposed method not only takes into account the number and size of opportunities, but also the possible activity duration at each activity location given its opening hours and the effect of transport network topology (e.g. one-way streets, turn restrictions and over-pass). Incorporating these elements into space-time measures helps overcome several shortcomings of previous approaches to evaluating space-time accessibility.},

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed very active development in two broad, but separate fields, both involving understanding and modeling of how individuals move in time and space (hereafter called "travel behavior analysis" or "human mobility analysis"). One field comprises transportation researchers who have been working in the field for decades and the other involves new comers from a wide range of disciplines, but primarily computer scientists and physicists. Researchers in these two fields work with different datasets, apply different methodologies, and answer different but overlapping questions. It is our view that there is much, hidden synergy between the two fields that needs to be brought out. It is thus the purpose of this paper to introduce datasets, concepts, knowledge and methods used in these two fields, and most importantly raise cross-discipline ideas for conversations and collaborations between the two. It is our hope that this paper will stimulate many future cross-cutting studies that involve researchers from both fields.},

abstract = {Introduction: Accessibility to healthcare is recognised as an important component in the uptake of healthcare. Accessibility gaps may underpin health inequalities and the burden often born by socially disadvantaged groups who experience higher levels of disease and have shorter lives. This study aims to identify, from the perspective of people on low incomes, the determinants of their ease of access to healthcare, and how this impacts upon short- and long-term mobility strategies for activity participation. Methods: The research takes a qualitative approach, guided by a conceptual framework that combines transport disadvantage and social exclusion perspectives with human needs theories. We employed focus groups to gather views and experiences on healthcare accessibility from 114 residents of 12 low-income neighbourhoods in S{\~{a}}o Paulo (Brazil). Results: Five emergent themes encompass the main barriers to healthcare accessibility, namely: proximity and remoteness, walking safety, public transport services, personal security issues, and quality of healthcare services. Participants explained the difficulties of gaining access to healthcare beyond factors such as location and distance. A range of inter-related, multidimensional factors shapes the accessibility of the poor to healthcare in S{\~{a}}o Paulo. Even under severe financial and time constraints, people may travel longer to access facilities perceived as adequate to respond to their health needs. Participants' narratives suggest a strong effect of healthcare inadequacies, such as the poor quality of the patient-provider relationship and the long times needed to receive medical care, on mobility strategies. Conclusions: Within policy setting agendas in Brazil, “objective” assessments of people's ability to access healthcare tend to over-emphasise the spatial separation between patients' home locations and the physical location of healthcare services, most notably in terms of travel time or distance. Tackling health inequalities requires planners to design integrated transport and health policies taking into consideration the adequacy and quality of both transport and healthcare services.},

abstract = {There is increasing consent about the importance of incorporating wider impacts to analyse transport projects and plans. Recent research reports the need to assess equity impacts of urban projects to better allocate resources. This has an even larger meaning in Latin America, because of great inequalities present. Additionally, literature about accessibility highlights the readiness of their indicators on assessing equitable access to opportunities Hence, this work explores ways to measure access inequality aimed towards better methodologies for transport project assessment. Chile represents an opportunity to develop this approach. Different accessibility measures for modelled future scenarios are analysed in the context of Santiago. The method builds from a simple accessibility formulation based on travel times forecasted by a four-step transport model. Using two subway projects as case study, methodological implications for assessment are then discussed. As a result, an index is proposed to incorporate equitable accessibility impacts parallel to CBA, which demands to further consolidate multi-criteria analysis. In the future it may also be possible to explore a value for accessibility to allow a different type of cost-benefit analysis. Conclusion remarks operational and concept issues that need to be addressed to further build a useful accessibility and equity indicators.},

abstract = {Although the concept of social equity seems to be ubiquitous in most mobility plans of major Latin American cities, when evaluating transport projects for financing and prioritisation there are no specific or solid indicators to measure how they can contribute to promoting better access to opportunities, particularly for the most vulnerable segments of the population. In response, we designed a methodology that uses the concepts of accessibility and affordability as a complementary means for evaluating public transport investment, and identifying transport disadvantages and priorities for project generation. This is based on the calculation of accessibility levels to the labour market for different zones of a given city, by introducing a function of impedance composed by travel time budget and the percentage of income spent on transportation.The characteristics of time and percentage of income spent for accessing work obtained from transportation surveys define the "real accessibility" to employment for all the zones of a city. Then, a stated preference survey was applied in order to determine the desired expenditure in both variables, and the accessibility to jobs in this new situation was subsequently calculated. We calculated a third type of accessibility, using "standard" values of travel time and expenditure budget.This methodology is therefore used to evaluate different policies in Bogota, corresponding to changes in the fare structure of the existing public transport system, by proposing the development of cross subsidies, and carrying out an appraised on the impact of the development of a new Bus Rapid Transit line. The results show that depending on the population, its location and purchasing power, the impact of a redistributive fare with respect to accessibility to the labour market can be greater than the expansion and improvement of the public transport network. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Bicycle-sharing programs have become prevalent and popular in many cities around the world, promoting a clean and sustainable modal option to residents and visitors. Chicago, with one of the most developed transit systems in the US, is no exception, and has been growing its bicycle-sharing programs to enhance mobility to greater portions of the city. As bicycle sharing programs have generally developed around and in conjunction with public transportation systems, e.g. near rail transit stations, they contribute to the accessibility of the overall public transportation system. This paper seeks to evaluate the impact of integrating shared bikes on the accessibility of a public transit system, by developing a model of public transit accessibility, and applying to the transit system of Chicago. The model proposed in this paper is a utility-based model in conjunction with choice behavior strategy for a hyperpath network. Transit station data and historical bike sharing data were explored to select frequent origin and destination (OD) pairs and multi-mode stations. Experiments were designed and conducted to measure the accessibility for visitor and commuter trips. Results from experiments show that the bike sharing program has successfully increased the accessibility of public transit in Chicago. The approach provides quantitative evaluation of multi-mode trips and provides insight of stations and routes for bike and ride trips.},

abstract = {This paper contributes to the emerging literature analysing public transit fare card data for a better understanding of passengers' mobility patterns and path choices. A new heuristic is proposed to estimate the stop-level origins and destinations by detecting the traveller activities in the observed transactions in a fare card dataset. The main focus in this research is estimating the actual passenger trajectories for multi-leg journeys. If the fare card dataset includes both boarding and alighting information of each transaction, the main challenge is the estimation of origins and destinations by distinguishing the transfer interchanges from the activity locations. Built on commonly used criteria for identifying transfers, this paper proposes a new method to improve the accuracy of short activity detection to estimate the passengers' true origins and destinations. The set of criteria in this research is based on the proposed concept of “off-optimality” for a more accurate identification of short/hidden activities within the labelled transfers. The measure of off-optimality incorporates different variables of the transit service between the given journey ends (including alternative paths and routes, service headways, walk distances/times, transfer points, etc.) and reflects those into a simple quantity to improve the accuracy of estimation. In addition to off-optimality, the time gap between two transactions, the total travel time, and the circuity of the path trajectories are other variables that are used in distinguishing the true transfers from activities. The proposed set of criteria is calibrated using a large endogenous set of fare card data from Brisbane, Australia, and is validated using a set of transit journeys and reported activities from a household travel survey.

abstract = {This paper shows how to recover the arrival times of trains from the gate times of metro passengers from Smart Card data. Such technique is essential when a log, the set of records indicating the actual arrival and departure time of each bus or train at each station and also a critical component in reliability analysis of a transportation system, is missing partially or entirely. The procedure reconstructs each train as a sequence of the earliest exit times, called S-epochs, among its alighting passengers at each stations. The procedure first constructs a set of passengers, also known as reference passengers, whose routing choices are easily identifiable. The procedure then computes, from the exit times of the reference passengers, a set of tentative S-epochs based on a detection measure whose validity relies on an extreme-value characteristic of the platform-to-gate movement of alighting passengers. The tentative S-epochs are then finalized to be a true one, or rejected, based on their consistencies with bounds and/or interpolation from prescribed S-epochs of adjacent trains and stations. Tested on 12 daily sets of trains, with varying degrees of missing logs, from three entire metro lines, the method restored the arrival times of 95{\%} of trains within the error of 24. s even when 100{\%} of logs was missing. The mining procedure can also be applied to trains operating under special strategies such as short-turning and skip-stop. The recovered log seems precise enough for the current reliability analysis performed by the city of Seoul.},

This article uses a large sample study to examine the impact of religious tradition on two indicators of concern about climate change within categories of political ideology. This study shows that religious affiliation moderates the impact of ideology, and that these interaction effects vary across religious traditions. Perhaps most significantly, this study reveals that religious affiliation is most influential on political liberals but has very little impact on conservatives. This holds significant implications for the way we understand the relationship between religion and environmental attitudes.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Accessibility is an important consideration in sustainable mobility policies, particularly for transit users. Measures suggested in the literature are based on coarse aggregate spatial resolution of traffic analysis zones that is sufficient for managing car travels only. To reflect a human door-to-door travel, transit accessibility demands an explicit viewof the location of origin, transit stops and destination, as well as of the temporal fit between transit lines timetable and traveler's needs. We thus estimate transit accessibility based on mode-specific travel times and corresponding paths, including walk- ing and waiting, at the resolution of individual buildings and stops. Car accessibility is estimated at a high resolution too. A novel repre- sentation of transit network as a graph is proposed. This representa- tion includes all modal components of a transit travel – walking, waiting at a stop, transit ride, transfers between lines, thus enabling unified view of a travel, regardless of mode. The use of modern high- performance graph database allows construction of high-resolution accessibility maps for an entiremetropolitan area with its 100–200 K buildings. The application is tested and applied in a case study involving the evaluation of the 2011 bus line reform in the city of Tel Aviv. Specifically, wedemonstrate thatwhile the reformincreased the average accessibility for the entire city the increase was not uniform with different areas of the city experiencing different abso- lute accessibility by transit and relative accessibility in comparison to car travel. The bus reform did in fact benefit travelers that experi- enced low relative accessibility, but the benefits are mainly accruing to longer trips. Our approach and computational methods can be employed for directly investigating the impacts of transportation infrastructure investments.},

abstract = {Accessibility is essentially a dynamic concept. However, most studies on urban accessibility take a static approach, overlooking the fact that accessibility conditions change dramatically throughout the day. Due to their high spatial and temporal resolution, the new data sources (Big Data) offer new possibilities for the study of accessibility. The aim of this paper is to analyse urban accessibility considering its two components –the performance of the transport network and the attractiveness of the destinations– using a dynamic approach using data from TomTom and Twitter respectively. This allows us to obtain profiles that highlight the daily variations in accessibility in the city of Madrid, and identify the influence of congestion and the changes in location of the population. These profiles reveal significant variations according to transport zones. Each transport zone has its own accessibility profile, and thus its own specific problems, which require solutions that are also specific.},

abstract = {Conventional integral measures of accessibility, although valuable as indicators of place accessibility, have several limitations when used to evaluate individual accessibility. Two alternatives for overcoming some of the difficulties involved are explored in this study. One is to adapt these measures for evaluating individual accessibility using a disaggregate, nonzonal approach. The other is to develop different types of measures based on an alternative conceptual framework. To pursue the former alternative, this study specifies and examines eighteen gravity-type and cumulative-opportunity accessibility measures using a point-based spatial framework. For the latter option, twelve space-time accessibility measures are developed based on the construct of a prism-constrained feasible opportunity set. This paper compares the relationships and spatial patterns of these thirty measures using network-based GIS procedures. Travel diary data collected in Columbus, Ohio, and a digital data set of 10,727 selected land parcels are used for all computation. Results of this study indicate that space-time and integral indices are distinctive types of accessibility measures which reflect different dimensions of the accessibility experience of individuals. Since space-time measures are more capable of capturing interpersonal differences, especially the effect of space-time constraints, they are more “gender sensitive” and helpful for unraveling gender/ethnic differences in accessibility. An important methodological implication is that whether accessibility is observed to be important or different between individuals depends heavily on whether the measure used is capable of revealing the kind of differences the analyst intends to observe.},

Maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and Bayesian inference methods are used to estimate the left behind probability mass function (LBPMF) for a given station and time period.

abstract = {Bus stops are important traffic facilities that affect the efficiency of transportation system as well as the characteristics of bus emissions, and the bus stop influence zone (BSIZ) is the basic to estimate the bus emissions. The primary objective of this study is to investigate how the potential factors affect the length of BSIZ. In this study, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model was implemented to build a relationship between the length of BSIZ and various contributing factors. The spatial heterogeneity of the length of BSIZ was explored, and the spatial distributions of parameter estimations were visualized. Five types of data including bus emission data, global positioning system (GPS) data, point of interest (POI) data, bus stop feature data, and road feature data were collected from Zhenjiang in China to illustrate the procedure. The results indicated that the urban form has a significant impact on the length of BSIZ, and strong spatial variability for the length of BSIZ is observed. The number of enterprises and companies around bus stops, the distance between the stop and intersection, road hierarchy, the number of public facilities, the queue length of buses, as well as traffic volume can significantly affect the length of BSIZ, and the estimated coefficients of each bus stop vary across regions. The results provided valuable insights which contribute to quantify and estimate the emissions generated near bus stops.},

abstract = {Relying mostly on travel time savings, cost-benefit analysis has been widely used in transport project appraisals in the Chilean context, with utility maximisation theory as its background. Nevertheless, subjective well-being advocates have challenged the notion of the rational man underlying this theory by proposing that other trip attributes, individual perceptions and personal features mediate satisfaction with travel, alongside global well-being. Using the recently-opened Line 6 of Metro de Santiago (Chile) as a case study, this research has two main aims: (1) to verify to what extent travel time savings, which support the cost-benefit analysis process, are present after the launching of the new line; and (2) analyse the perception of passengers' travel time savings, and to what extent this element contributes to the travel satisfaction and to the global well-being at the individual level. Using passive data from smart cards, the results show that travel times decreased by 14{\%} in comparable trips after the launching of Line 6. Furthermore, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) construct is proposed, including travel and life satisfaction as latent variables of the model. This revealed that travel times in the Metro system are highly valued by people. However, this element does not mediate travel satisfaction, as users take low travel times for granted. Waiting times, stations' design, safety and intermodality are perceived attributes that effectively mediate travel satisfaction. Moreover, the latter variable has a relevant influence on global life satisfaction, revealing that transport conditions mediate in day-to-day well-being. These results challenged travel time savings as the most important driver in transport projects' appraisal processes, and some recommendations are made in order to incorporate these findings in future appraisals.},

abstract = {Investments in public transit infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean often aim to reduce spatial and social inequalities by improving accessibility to jobs and other opportunities. The Metropolitano, Lima's BRT project at inception, had, as one of its central goals, to connect low income populations living in the peripheries to jobs in the city center. We examine the contribution of Lima's Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system to accessibility to employment in the city, particularly for low-income public transit users. We build on secondary datasets of employment, household socio-demographics and Origin-Destination surveys before and after the BRT began operations to assess its effects on potential accessibility to employment. Findings suggest that the BRT line reduced travel times to reach jobs, in comparison with traditional public transport in the city, amongst populations living within walking distance of the system. However, we also find that the coverage of the BRT is minimal in areas with high concentrations of poor and extreme poor populations, limiting the equitability of the accessibility improvements. We present a reflection on the distributional effects of BRT infrastructure and services, discussing policy avenues that can improve the prospects for BRT system investments to include the poor in their mobility benefits.},

abstract = {Commercial bus speed is a key factor in the operation of public transport systems because it represents a direct measure of the quality of service provided to users and also considerably affects system costs. By commercial speed, we are referring to the average speed of buses over stretches, including all operational stops. Evaluating system performance by monitoring the commercial speed provided by bus services is highly desirable; however, in dense networks, it becomes a difficult task because of the amount of information required to implement such a monitoring procedure. The introduction of GPS technology in buses can overcome this difficulty in terms of information availability, although it presents the challenge of processing huge amounts of data in a systematic way. Here, we present a method based on GPS-generated data to systematically monitor average commercial bus speeds. The framework can be applied to each bus route as a whole, as well as over segments of arbitrary length, and can be divided into time intervals of arbitrary duration. The results are presented as matrices and graphs that can be read and interpreted easily. We discuss the potential of this methodology to provide useful insights for bus system planners and operators. The method and its applications are illustrated with data coming from the Santiago-Chile public transport system (Transantiago), where GPS observations of more than 6000 buses operating on over 700 different routes are available every 30. s. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Accessibility is an important consideration in sustainable mobility policies, particularly for transit users. Measures suggested in the literature are based on coarse aggregate spatial resolution of traffic analysis zones that is sufficient for managing car travels only. To reflect a human door-to-door travel, transit accessibility demands an explicit viewof the location of origin, transit stops and destination, as well as of the temporal fit between transit lines timetable and traveler's needs. We thus estimate transit accessibility based on mode-specific travel times and corresponding paths, including walk- ing and waiting, at the resolution of individual buildings and stops. Car accessibility is estimated at a high resolution too. A novel repre- sentation of transit network as a graph is proposed. This representa- tion includes all modal components of a transit travel – walking, waiting at a stop, transit ride, transfers between lines, thus enabling unified view of a travel, regardless of mode. The use of modern high- performance graph database allows construction of high-resolution accessibility maps for an entiremetropolitan area with its 100–200 K buildings. The application is tested and applied in a case study involving the evaluation of the 2011 bus line reform in the city of Tel Aviv. Specifically, wedemonstrate thatwhile the reformincreased the average accessibility for the entire city the increase was not uniform with different areas of the city experiencing different abso- lute accessibility by transit and relative accessibility in comparison to car travel. The bus reform did in fact benefit travelers that experi- enced low relative accessibility, but the benefits are mainly accruing to longer trips. Our approach and computational methods can be employed for directly investigating the impacts of transportation infrastructure investments.},

A method is presented for the detection and estimation of the location, time, duration, and purpose of activities undertaken by public transit users with the use of smart card databases and other available information about land use and user behavior. The method is applied to cases in Santiago, Chile, and Gatineau, Quebec, Canada, to identify activity purpose and time frame to characterize user behavior. The results obtained for each city are compared to discover differences in behavioral activity patterns due to sociological, cultural, and geopolitical differences.},

abstract = {The concept of accessibility – the ease with which people can reach places or opportunities –lies at the heart of what makes cities livable, workable and sustainable. As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart' urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to {\~{}}9000 and {\~{}}124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as {\~{}}8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart' urban investment strategies.},

In this study, we consider the data obtained from smart subway fare card transactions to characterize and model urban mobility patterns. We present a simple mobility model for predicting peoples' visited locations using the popularity of places in the city as an interaction parameter between different individuals. This ingredient is sufficient to reproduce several characteristics of the observed travel behavior such as: the number of trips between different locations in the city, the exploration of new places and the frequency of individual visits of a particular location. Moreover, we indicate the limitations of the proposed model and discuss open questions in the current state of the art statistical models of human mobility.},

To reduce the cost and time spent on surveys, individual trajectory data obtained from mobile devices has been used as an alternative dataset since the last two decades for OD estimation but also constrained in practice in some countries. To estimate OD matrices while protecting privacy, this study uses aggregated data of mobile phone traces to estimate work-related trips. The proposed approach is a sequential updater based on the maximum entropy principle. Trip production and attraction are firstly calculated by a non-linear programming problem followed by a matrix fitting problem to distribute trips to each OD pair. Numerical study shows that updated values are much closer to the synthesize real values than the referred ones. The case study in Tokyo further demonstrates that the proposed updating approach can track the change of travel pattern.},

abstract = {Smart card transactions capture rich information of human mobility and urban dynamics, therefore are of particular interest to urban planners and location-based service providers. However, since most transaction systems are only designated for billing purpose, typically, fine-grained location information, such as the exact boarding and alighting stops of a bus trip, is only partially or not available at all, which blocks deep exploitation of this rich and valuable data at individual level. This paper presents a "space alignment" framework to reconstruct individual mobility history from a large-scale smart card transaction dataset pertaining to a metropolitan city. Specifically, we show that by delicately aligning the monetary space and geospatial space with the temporal space, we are able to extrapolate a series of critical domain specific constraints. Later, these constraints are naturally incorporated into a semi-supervised conditional random field to infer the exact boarding and alighting stops of all transit routes with a surprisingly high accuracy, e.g., given only 10{\%} trips with known alighting/boarding stops, we successfully inferred more than 78{\%} alighting and boarding stops from all unlabeled trips. In addition, we demonstrated that the smart card data enriched by the proposed approach dramatically improved the performance of a conventional method for identifying users' home and work places (with 88{\%} improvement on home detection and 35{\%} improvement on work place detection). The proposed method offers the possibility to mine individual mobility from common public transit transactions, and showcases how uncertain data can be leveraged with domain knowledge and constraints, to support cross-application data mining tasks.},

abstract = {A methodology for estimating the destination of passenger journeys from automated fare collection (AFC) system data is described. It proposes new spatial validation features to increase the accuracy of destination inference results and to verify key assumptions present in previous origin–destination estimation literature. The methodology applies to entry-only system configurations combined with distance-based fare structures, and it aims to enhance raw AFC system data with the destination of individual journeys. This paper describes an algorithm developed to implement the methodology and the results from its application to bus service data from Porto. The data relate to an AFC system integrated with an automatic vehicle location system that records a transaction for each passenger boarding a bus, containing attributes regarding the route, the vehicle, and the travel card used, along with the time and the location where the journey began. Some of these are recorded for the purpose of allowing onboard ticket inspection but additionally enable innovative spatial validation features introduced by the methodology. The results led to the conclusion that the methodology is effective for estimating journey destinations at the disaggregate level and identifies false positives reliably.},

These logics successfully indicate the route segment with a low Level of Service (LOS) for metro punctuality and bus operational speeds during peak hours (i.e., 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.). Further, a relationship between vehicle occupancy and punctuality on certain transit route segments is easily found based on the logical analysis.

abstract = {In recent years smartcards have been implemented in many transit systems around the world as a means by which passengers pay for travel. In addition to allowing speedier boardings there are many secondary benefits of smartcard systems including better understanding of travel patterns and behaviour of travellers. Such research is dependent on the smartcard correctly recording the boarding stop, and where available the alighting stop. It is also dependent on the smartcard system correctly aggregating individual rides into trips.This paper identifies causes for why smartcard systems may not correctly record such information. The first contribution of the paper is to propose a set of rules to aggregate individual rides into a single trip. This is critical in the research of activity based modelling as well as for correctly charging the passenger. The second contribution of the paper is to provide an approach to identify erroneous tap-out data, either caused by system problems or by the user. An approach to detecting this phenomenon is provided. The output from this analysis is then used to identify faulty vehicles or data supply using the "comparison against peers approach". This third contribution of the paper identifies where transit agencies and operators should target resources to improve performance of their Automatic Vehicle Location systems. This method could also be used to identify users who appear to be tapping out too early.The approaches are tested using smartcard data from the Singapore public transport network from one week in April 2011. The results suggest that approximately 7.7{\%} of all smartcard rides recorded the passenger as alighting one stop before the bus stop that they most probably alighted at. A further 0.7{\%} of smartcard rides recorded the passenger as alighting more than one stop before the bus stop that they most probably alighted at. There was no evidence that smartcards overestimated the distance travelled by the passenger.},

abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

abstract = {The spatial–temporal accessibility of a transport system assesses the spatial–temporal constraints faced by individuals based on their fixed activities and the ability of the transport system to facilitate trading time for space in movement. Previous studies either measured the individual spatial–temporal accessibility of a general transport network or measured the cumulative-opportunity accessibility by public transit through an exclusive computation of the bottom of the full network time prism. By contrast, the current study measures the individual spatial–temporal accessibility by public transit by integrating timetable and passenger departure time and computing the full network time prism. A public transit network is modelled as a time-dependent weighted directed graph, wherein every single directed arc is associated with a time-dependent travel time to represent the linkage between two adjacent stops on a transit route. The time-dependent travel time assigned to arcs is determined according to timetables, which is particularly assigned to infinity when transit service is unavailable between two stops. A modified network potential path area (N-PPA) algorithm based on the time-dependent weighted directed graph is employed to produce a potential path area for the activity participation of an individual by public transit. The proposed methodology is applied as a case study to measure individual spatial–temporal accessibility using the Salt Lake City TRAX system. Results indicate that the outcome of the proposed methodology is sensitive to departure time of passengers. The results of this study provide suggestions on potential improvement of bus/rail line layout and timetables and may aid in trip planning of passengers.},

abstract = {To mitigate the congestion caused by the ever increasing number of privately owned automobiles, public transit is highly promoted by transportation agencies worldwide. A better understanding of travel patterns and regularity at the "magnitude" level will enable transit authorities to evaluate the services they offer, adjust marketing strategies, retain loyal customers and improve overall transit performance. However, it is fairly challenging to identify travel patterns for individual transit riders in a large dataset. This paper proposes an efficient and effective data-mining procedure that models the travel patterns of transit riders in Beijing, China. Transit riders' trip chains are identified based on the temporal and spatial characteristics of their smart card transaction data. The Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm then analyzes the identified trip chains to detect transit riders' historical travel patterns and the K-Means++ clustering algorithm and the rough-set theory are jointly applied to cluster and classify travel pattern regularities. The performance of the rough-set-based algorithm is compared with those of other prevailing classification algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed rough-set-based algorithm outperforms other commonly used data-mining algorithms in terms of accuracy and efficiency. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Increasing the proportion of commuters travelling by public transportation can effectively ease urban traffic congestion. This paper addresses the application of Advanced Public Transportation Systems (APTS) data to analyze transit commuters travel demand. This study involved collection of APTS data and boarding stops information by combining smart card data and intelligent dispatching data. Transit commuters were judged according to travel frequency of morning and evening traffic peaks. The residences and work places were identified by spatial-temporal characteristics of commuters travel. Based on this idea, an estimation algorithm was proposed. The algorithm was tested and analyzed using large-scale APTS data. Finally, the method's accuracy was analyzed by comparison with the "Trip-chain" method. The proposed method provides some advantages including, high accuracy and strong operability. The study provides a fast and economic new approach to acquiring transit commuters Origin-Destination (OD) distribution. ?? 2013 Journal of Transportation Systems Engineering and Information Technology.},

However, if the card is not personalized, there is no socioeconomic information available, which imposes a limitation on the types of analysis that can be performed. This work presents a simple method to estimate the residence zone of card users, which will allow socioeconomic variables to be estimated, thereby enriching the analytical possibilities. The method, which is based on the observation of morning transactions of frequent users, is applied to a sample of over 2 million cards. The method is evaluated using a sample from the Santiago ODS where users declared their card id and also declared their home address. A sample of 888,970 cards that are observed at least three days in a week and show spatial regularity for the morning transaction is used for zone of residence estimation and analysis of travel patterns and time use. The results show that users who live in the city center or in the wealthier East zone experience lower travel time, spend more time at home and less time at work.},

abstract = {Smartcard data provide a great number of information that are increasingly used nowadays. In the field of transport, they offer the opportunity to study passenger behavior, leading to a better knowledge of public transit demand and thereby granting the transport operators the ability to adapt their transport offer and services accordingly, both in space and in time. In particular, an accurate characterization of mobility patterns using data mining approches has a very strong interest for transport planning purposes. This paper aims to propose a two-level generative mixture model that partitions passengers according to their temporal profiles. Using the timestamps of the passengers' transactions in the public transport network, the first level models the passengers partitioning into a reduced set of clusters, whereas the second level captures how the trips made by each cluster of passengers are distributed over time. The proposed approach is applied on real ticketing data collected from the urban transport network of Rennes M??tropole (France). The obtained results show that different passenger profiles can be discovered, thus highlighting several patterns of transport demand. The crossing of the clustering results with smartcard fare types as well as city characteristics such as academic centralities is also conducted in order to identify the close link between urban mobility and the socio-economic characteristics of the city.},

abstract = {Using Beijing as an example, this research demonstrates that smartcard data can be used to (a) assemble the required data for excess commuting studies, and (b) visualise related results. Based on both smartcard and household travel survey data, we find that the theoretical minimum commute is considerably lower for bus users than for car users in Beijing. This suggests that there is a greater inter-mixing of jobs-housing functions (i.e., a better jobs-housing balance) associated with users of that mode compared to the corresponding land-use arrangement for car users, who locate further from the central area (Tian'anmen) than bus users. The commuting range for car users is 9.4. km greater than for bus users. Excess commuting is slightly higher for bus users (69.5{\%}) than for car users (68.8{\%}). Commuting capacity values are slightly lower for car users than for bus users, implying that car users consume less of their available commuting resources overall than bus users, albeit only marginally.},

abstract = {A recursive logit model is proposed for path choice modeling with transit smart card data in higher-frequency bus and rail services. In such circumstances, it is commonly assumed that passengers may arrive randomly to a stop and may behave according to a "strategy"; such a strategy is associated with a so-called "attractive" set of routes: a passenger selects a set of routes departing from the stop, and will board the next vehicle to depart from among that set of routes. We extend the conventional notion of attractive sets by introducing a measure of "attractiveness" that allows for randomness in the choice of attractive routes.The proposed model uses a link-based (recursive, or sequential choice) formulation, rather than a path-based formulation, which has the advantage of including all path alternatives without the need for path set enumeration. The recursive formulation is also very suitable for smart card data because it allows model calibration with incomplete path choice observations.The link-based approach was originally advocated by in the strategy-based transit assignment context, but without investigating methods for model calibration or empirical analysis. Recently, and have presented methods to empirically estimate traffic path choice models using a link-based formulation. Our framework builds off these previous works to formulate and estimate a strategy-based path choice model with smart card data. The proposed model is tested with a 6 months extract from the smart card transactions in Brisbane, Australia, for two popular origin-destination pairs with diverse path alternatives.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for accessibility categorization in areas where there is no extensive data available to run the conventional analysis. The presented method has the advantages of the lower data requirements and the utility of the results. Three benchmarks were selected to evaluate transit accessibility. The first one (transit coverage) investigates the spread of the service, and it is used to assess the percentage of people in a district that can access the service within a comfortable access distance. The second (transit supply) is an effectiveness measure of the magnitude of available infrastructures such as stops, or stations over the population or land area of the underlying region. The third (route diversity) represents the variety of routes to and from different areas via transit services. Various indicators were used to assess these benchmarks. Within the context of multi-criteria decision-making, TOPSIS (Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) allows the direct comparison of measures of different units, and it is used to evaluate the relative scores of the various districts' benchmark. A K-clustering method was used to numerically categorize the areas into five groups, reflecting on the criteria levels. A case study of Abu Dhabi city is used to demonstrate the details of the procedures. The detailed analyses were used to depict districts and corridors with particular deficiencies and as such suggesting remedy strategies. The method can help transit authorities identifying the most suitable types of facilities, infrastructure, or routes that a district may need to improve its accessibility.},

abstract = {Abstract To discover regularities in human mobility is of fundamental importance to our understand- ing of urban dynamics, and essential to city and transport planning, urban management and policymaking. Previous research has revealed universal regularities atmainly aggregated spatio-temporal scales but when we zoom into finer scales, considerable heterogeneity and diversity is observed instead. The fundamental question we address in this paper is at what scales are the regularities we detect stable, explicable, and sustainable. This paper thus proposes a basic measure of variability to assess the stability of such regularities focusing mainly on changes over a range of temporal scales.We demonstrate this by comparing reg- ularities in the urban mobility patterns in three world cities, namely London, Singapore and Beijing using one-week of smart-card data. The results show that variations in regularity scale as non-linear functions of the temporal resolution, which we measure over a scale from 1 minute to 24 hours thus reflecting the diurnal cycle of human mobility. A particularly dramatic increase in variability occurs up to the temporal scale of about 15 minutes in all three cities and this implies that limits exist when we look forward or backward with respect to making short-term predictions. The degree of regularity varies in fact from city to city with Beijing and Singapore showing higher regularity in comparison to London across all tempo- ral scales. A detailed discussion is provided, which relates the analysis to various character- istics of the three cities. In summary, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of regularities in patterns of transit use from variations in volumes of travellers entering subway stations, it establishes a generic analytical framework for comparative studies using urban mobility data, and it provides key points for themanagement of variability by policy-makers intent on for making the travel experience more amenable.},

abstract = {While Big Data is seen as an emerging technology to both practitioners and researchers, significant challenges may arise for academia, Federal and State agencies, industry, and other organizations. Discovering novel ways to manage and analyze big data to create value would increase the accuracy of predictions, improve the management and security of transportation infrastructure and enable informed decision-making. It is these challenges that may drive new insights and opportunities and transform the way we perceive transportation and traffic engineering phenomena. Big Data has been rapidly expanding into the transportation arena. However, the methods, models and algorithms that are used today in our domain to mine and explore data – think of estimation, prediction, validation of traffic and transporta-tion theories and models – may not scale and/or perform well under these new conditions. In fact, in many disciplines in our field, particularly those that are classically ''data-poor and assumption-rich " (e.g. activity scheduling and choice modelling), big data may lead us to rethinking existing theories and models altogether. The aim of this special issue was to highlight recent research in Big Data applications that could help establishing fundamental knowledge, concepts and technologies related to transportation and traffic engineering. This special issue includes seventeen outstanding contributions covering various transportation applications from travel demand estimation to real time traffic operations and safety monitoring. Broadly speaking, these seventeen papers can be categorized into three groups: (1) transportation planning; (2) traffic operations; and (3) safety. The first category dealing with transportation planning includes nine papers. These papers utilize mobile phone's call detail records, smart card systems, automatic passenger count systems, GPS, smart phone and vehicle location services, bike-sharing and social media data, and present big data applications, such as travel demand estimation, transit origin– destination estimation, daily travel pattern analysis, non-work destination choice, transit travel experience, origin– destination estimation by trip purpose and time of day, willingness to travel by activity types, and traffic zoning. With respect to the second category papers dealing with traffic operations, four papers are included. These papers exploit big data sources from GPS, Bluetooth reader, loop detector, private sector travel time, and floating cars for traffic flow prediction, travel time prediction, addressing GPS data requirements, and route travel time distribution. Finally, the third category of papers dealing with safety includes four papers. Big data sources used in this category come from video, microwave vehicle detection system, GPS, and vehicle trajectory data. This section includes applications on proactive road safety analysis, traffic operations and safety monitoring, calibration of traffic simulation model for safety assessment, and instantaneous driving decisions modeling. We dedicate this issue to the loving memory of Matthew G. Karlaftis, EiC of Transportation Research Part C, a thoughtful friend and an inspiring colleague, who met an untimely death before the completion of this issue.},

abstract = {Smart card datasets in the public transit network provide opportunities to analyse the behaviour of passengers as individuals or as groups. Studying passenger behaviour in both spatial and temporal space is important because it helps to find the pattern of mobility in the network. Also, clustering passengers based on their trips regarding both spatial and temporal similarity measures can improve group-based transit services such as Demand-Responsive Transit (DRT). Clustering passengers based on their trips can be carried out by different methods, which are investigated in this paper. This paper sheds light on differences between sequential and combined spatial and temporal clustering alternatives in the public transit network. Firstly, the spatial and temporal similarity measures between passengers are defined. Secondly, the passengers are clustered using a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm by three different methods including sequential two-step spatial-temporal (S-T), sequential two-step temporal-spatial (T-S), and combined one-step spatiotemporal (ST) clustering. Thirdly, the characteristics of the resultant clusters are described and compared using maps, numerical and statistical values, cross correlation techniques, and temporal density plots. Furthermore, some passengers are selected to show how differently the three methods put the passengers in groups. Four days of smart card data comprising 80,000 passengers in Brisbane, Australia, are selected to compare these methods. The analyses show that while the sequential methods (S-T and T-S) discover more diverse spatial and temporal patterns in the network, the ST method entails more robust groups (higher spatial and temporal similarity values inside the groups).},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization is placing increasing stress on already burdened transportation infrastructure. Ubiquitous mobile computing and the massive data it generates presents new opportunities to measure the demand for this infrastructure, diagnose problems, and plan for the future. However, before these benefits can be realized, methods and models must be updated to integrate these new data sources into existing urban and transportation planning frameworks for estimating travel demand and infrastructure usage. While recent work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records, and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative origin-destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system's output. We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary transportation demand modeling.},

Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data ana-lytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech?

abstract = {There is relatively little research on accessibility using public transit as the travel mode. Yet understanding public transit accessibility is important for encouraging mode shifts to reduce car reliance and is essential for the wellbeing of non-car households. The paper describes two measures of public transit access. The first is a combined public transit and walking accessibility index, which measures potential access to destinations via public transit and walking modes. The second is a transit frequency measure, which is a measure of transit service level in an area. These two measures extend current public transit accessibility measures by including all components of the public transit journey, calculating accessibility at the parcel level and providing a measure of public transit service. Results for the Auckland region show that although 94.4{\%} of the urban population live in areas with medium-high public transit and walking access, only 26.5{\%} of the urban population also have an average transit frequency of two or more trips per hour per stop. Moreover, only 5{\%} of the urban population live in areas with an average transit frequency of more than four services per hour per stop. This work highlights the importance of including measures of transit frequency when investigating public transit access. The results also reveal the potential to use these measures to gain a more complete and realistic picture of public transit access and to explore the potential for mode substitution and accessibility for non-car households. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been increased interest in using completely anonymized data from smart card collection systems to better understand the behavioural habits of public transport passengers. Such an understanding can benefit urban transport planners as well as urban modelling by providing simulation models with realistic mobility patterns of transit networks. In particular, the study of temporal activities has elicited substantial interest. In this regard, a number of methods have been developed in the literature for this type of analysis, most using clustering approaches. This paper presents a two-level generative model that applies the Gaussian mixture model to regroup passengers based on their temporal habits in their public transportation usage. The strength of the proposed methodology is that it can model a continuous representation of time instead of having to employ discrete time bins. For each cluster, the approach provides typical temporal patterns that enable easy interpretation. The experiments are performed on five years of data collected by the Soci{\'{e}}t{\'{e}} de transport de l'Outaouais. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach in identifying a reduced set of passenger clusters linked to their fare types. A five-year longitudinal analysis also shows the relative stability of public transport usage.},

abstract = {In recent years, rapid advances in information technology have led to various data collection systems which are enriching the sources of empirical data for use in transport systems. Currently, traffic data are collected through various sensors including loop detectors, probe vehicles, cell-phones, Bluetooth, video cameras, remote sensing and public transport smart cards. It has been argued that combining the complementary information from multiple sources will generally result in better accuracy, increased robustness and reduced ambiguity. Despite the fact that there have been substantial advances in data assimilation techniques to reconstruct and predict the traffic state from multiple data sources, such methods are generally data-driven and do not fully utilize the power of traffic models. Furthermore, the existing methods are still limited to freeway networks and are not yet applicable in the urban context due to the enhanced complexity of the flow behavior. The main traffic phenomena on urban links are generally caused by the boundary conditions at intersections, un-signalized or signalized, at which the switching of the traffic lights and the turning maneuvers of the road users lead to shock-wave phenomena that propagate upstream of the intersections. This paper develops a new model-based methodology to build up a real-time traffic prediction model for arterial corridors using data from multiple sources, particularly from loop detectors and partial observations from Bluetooth and GPS devices.},

abstract = {Choice models are today ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the 'right' model of choice to use. Since models of choice are inherently high dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a-priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially sub-optimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and over/under-fitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a 'generic' model of consumer choice (namely, dis-tributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a non-parametric approach in which the data automatically selects the 'right' choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major US automaker, our method demonstrates a 20{\%} improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the art benchmark models, which can result in a 10{\%} increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step towards 'automating' the crucial task of choice model selection.},

abstract = {Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However, allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles. Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility measures to a dollar value.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, several techniques have been developed for using smart card fare data to estimate origin-destination (O-D) matrices for public transport. In the past, different walking distance and allowable transfer time assumptions had been applied because of a lack of information about the alighting stop for a trip. Such assumptions can significantly affect the accuracy of the estimated O-D matrices. Little evidence demonstrates the accuracy of O-D pairs estimated with smart card fare data. Unique smart card fare data from Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, offered an opportunity to assess previous methods and their assumptions. South East Queensland data were used to study the effects of different assumptions on estimated O-D matrices and to conduct a sensitivity analysis for different parameters. In addition, an algorithm was proposed for generating an O-D matrix from individual user transactions (trip legs). About 85{\%} of the transfer time was non walking time (wait and short activity time). More than 90{\%} of passengers walked less than 10 min to transfer between alighting and the next boarding stop; this time represented about 10{\%} of the allowable transfer time. A change in the assumed allowable transfer time from 15 to 90 min had a minor effect on the estimated O-D matrices. Most passengers returned to within 800 m of their first origin on the same day.},

abstract = {To improve customer satisfaction and reduce operation costs, transit authorities have been striving to monitor transit service quality and identify the key factors to enhance it. The recent advent of passive data collection technologies, e.g.,automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL), has shifted a data-poor environment to a data-rich environment and offered opportunities for transit agencies to conduct comprehensive transit system performance measures. However, most AFC and AVL systems are not designed for transit performance measures, implying that additional data processing and visualization procedures are needed to improve both data usability and accessibility. This study attempts to develop a data-driven platform for online transit performance monitoring. The primary data sources come from the AFC and AVL systems in Beijing, where a passenger's boarding stop (origin) and alighting stop (destination) on a flat-rate bus are not recorded. The individual transit rider's origin and destination can be estimated by utilizing a series of data-mining techniques, which are then incorporated into a regional-map platform for transit performance measures. A multilevel framework is proposed to calculate the network-level speed, route-level travel time reliability, stop-level ridership, and headway variance. These statistics are interactively displayed on a map through a simplified transit GIS data model. This platform not only serves as a data-rich visualization platform to monitor transit network performance for planning and operations, it also intends to take advantage of e-science initiative for data-driven transportation research and applications.},

Here we shed light on this surprising coexistence by systematically investigating the impact of recurrent mobility on the characteristic distance travelled by individuals. Using both mobile phone and GPS data, we discover the existence of two distinct classes of individuals: returners and explorers. As existing models of human mobility cannot explain the existence of these two classes, we develop more realistic models able to capture the empirical findings. Finally, we show that returners and explorers play a distinct quantifiable role in spreading phenomena and that a correlation exists between their mobility patterns and social interactions},

abstract = {The article claims that a passenger in A will not use just any of a number of available routes. Because some routes might have a very long travel time to reach B, he may disregard them. In that way, the passenger operates a selection: among the set of all routes passing through A and B, he will select a subset so as to minimize his total expected travel time, which is made up of his expected waiting time plus his expected travel time. Once this subset is selected, the passenger will take the first vehicle serving one of the routes in this subset to arrive at A. The purpose of this paper is to present a probabilistic framework for the study of this problem, which takes into account the frequencies and the speeds of each competing A. In this paper the problem of the determination of the expected travel time is regarded as an optimization problem. The approach used allows the consideration of any distribution function for first arrival time of a vehicle on a route. In practice, the cases of uniform and exponential distributions are of much interest: they are studied in greater detail.},

These accessibility calculations are accomplished using only publicly-available data sources. A binomial logic model is estimated which predicts the likelihood that a commuter will choose transit rather than auto for a commute trip based on aggregate characteristics of the surrounding area. Variables in this model include demographic factors as well as detailed accessibility calculations for both transit and auto. The mode achieves a $\rho$2 value of 0.597, and analysis of the results suggests that continuous accessibility of transit systems may be a valuable tool for use in modeling and forecasting.},

In recent years, methodological advances have been made in the estimation of origin–destination matrices from disaggregate fare transaction and vehicle location data. Unlike manual origin–destination surveys, these methods provide nearly complete spatial and temporal coverage at minimal marginal cost. Early models inferred destinations on the basis of the proximity of possible destinations to the next origin and disregarded the effect of waiting time, invehicle time, and the number of transfers on path choice. The research reported here formulated a dynamic programming model that inferred destinations of public transportation trips on the basis of a generalized disutility minimization objective. The model inferred paths and transfers on multileg journeys and worked on systems that served a mix of gated stations and ungated stops. The model is being used to infer destinations of public transportation trips in Boston, Massachusetts, and is producing better results than could be obtained with earlier models.},

abstract = {Location Based Services (LBS) provide a new perspective for spatiotemporally analyzing dynamic urban systems. Research has investigated urban dynamics using LBS. However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job-housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs-housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, a growing international trend has been the implementation of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) as a cost-effective way to enhance urban public transport (UPT) service quality and progress towards sustainable urban transport. To date, in excess of 40 cities worldwide operate BRT within their UPT networks. Despite the international prominence of BRT systems, there has been limited in-depth investigation of their spatial-temporal dynamics. Drawing on a case study BRT system, Brisbane, Australia, we apply a geo-visualisation-based method to a large smart card database to examine spatial-temporal dynamics. The conditional flow-maps (or flow-comaps) are created to visually compare the spatial trajectories of BRT trips and other bus-based trips and their variation by calendar events (i.e., a workday, a weekend, a school holiday and a public holiday). The results highlight (1) marked differences between BRT-based trips to those bus trips undertaken on the broader UPT network; (2) spatial heterogeneity in BRT trips; and (3) the potential of drawing on 'big data' to support evidence-based BRT planning. These findings render important implications with the capacity to inform future BRT strategy as it relates to service management and infrastructure expansion. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

This paper proposes a method for mining spatial regular origins-destinations and temporal habitual travelling time from transit users. These travel regularity are discussed as being useful for transit planning. After reconstructing the travel itineraries, three levels of Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Application with Noise (DBSCAN) have been utilised to retrieve travel regularity of each of each frequent transit users. Analyses of passenger classifications and personal travel time variability estimation are performed as the examples of using travel regularity in transit planning.

abstract = {Automatic Data Collection (ADQ systems can enhance the ability of transit agencies to obtain useful planning information that was previously too expensive to obtain. This thesis documents the development of an algorithm to estimate a Bus Passenger Trip Origin- Destination Matrix (OD Matrix) based on ADC system archived data including Automated Fare Collection (AFQ data, Automatic Passenger Count (APQ data, and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data. This algorithm consists of three steps: data preparation, estimation of a Single Route OD Matrices for all routes, and estimation of a Network Level OD Matrix using transfer flow information. The single route OD matrix estimation requires the development of a "seed" matrix derived primarily from AFC data and the "marginal" control totals, i.e. the boarding and alighting counts, derived primarily from APC data. Both Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) techniques are used to estimate the single route OD matrices based on seed matrices and marginal values, and the results from these two techniques are compared. For the network level OD matrix estimation, we estimate the transfer flows by considering the consecutive transactions from AFC data. The resulting network level OD matrix is provided at a route segment level (3-5 combined stops) of detail. This OD estimation algorithm is illustrated by its application to a selected corridor of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) bus network This OD estimation algorithm can be practically applied to a full-size bus network It is recommended that the MLE method be used to estimate the single route OD matrices and the proportional distribution method be used to estimate the transfer flow OD matrix.},

abstract = {Efficient public transport (PT) networks are vital for well-functioning and sustainable cities. Compared to other modes of transport, PT networks feature inherent systemic complexity due to their schedule-dependence and network organization. Because of this, efficient PT network planning and management calls for advanced modeling and analysis tools. These tools have to take into account how people use PT networks, including factors such as demand, accessibility, trip planning and navigability. From the PT user perspective, the common criteria for planning trips include waiting times to departure, journey durations, and the number of required transfers. However, waiting times and transfers have typically been neglected in PT accessibility studies and related decision-support tools. Here, we tackle this issue by introducing a decision-support framework for PT planners and managers, based on temporal networks methodology. This framework allows for computing pre-journey waiting times, journey durations, and number of required transfers for all Pareto-optimal journeys between any origin–destination pair, at all points in time. We visualize this information as a temporal distance profile, covering any given time interval. Based on such profiles, we define the best-case, mean, and worst-case measures for PT travel time and number of required PT vehicle boardings, and demonstrate their practical utility to PT planning through a series of accessibility case studies. By visualizing the computed measures on a map and studying their relationships by performing an all-to-all analysis between 7463 PT stops in the Helsinki metropolitan region, we show that each of the measures provides a different perspective on accessibility. To pave the way towards more comprehensive understanding of PT accessibility, we provide our methods and full analysis pipeline as free and open source software.},

abstract = {This chapter contributes to the improvement of GPS-based travel surveying by introducing a combined method of GPS, GIS and web-based user interaction, which has been applied in large- scale fieldwork in the netherlands. With over 1000 participants, as far as we know, this is the first time that a GPS-based method that measures travel mode choice as well as the location and type of destinations that are visited has been used on such a large scale. The chapter focuses in particular on the identification of travel modes and destinations, which is still an under-researched issue.Our approach concentrates on the issue of deriving and validating the purpose of trip destinations and travel modes, while also allowing reliable multi-day data collection. The method consists of an interpretation process and a validation process. The interpretation process uses spatial data (e.g. railways, shops) and characteristics of the respondents (e.g. home address, possession of cars) to interpret data from the logs. The travel behaviour data that result from this interpretation round can be adjusted and added to by the respondents in a validation application. The link between both processes is interactive; when new individual characteristics (e.g. the address of a friend's house) are entered by the respondents, these characteristics will be used for further interpretation of the data.The remainder of this chapter is structured as follows. The following section gives an overview of the advantages and drawbacks of current GPS-based data collection methods that are suitable for measuring choice of travel mode and/or trip destinations. The subsequent section describes the GPS-based method that we developed and in section four the value of our method is evaluated by presenting the results of the fieldwork we recently undertook. The results are compared with results from an internet survey that was carried out at an earlier date and also with the Dutch Travel Survey (DTS) that uses paper diaries. The chapter ends with conclusions on the use of GPS-based methods for the collection of travel behaviour data and a discussion of future possibilities.},

abstract = {Planning organizations are increasingly looking to accessibility measures to understand how well the transportation system provides access to employment opportunities. However, the most common type of job accessibility measure employed in planning practice, the cumulative opportunity measure, considers job supply but overlooks competition for jobs. Therefore, the cumulative opportunity measure may not fully capture workers' access to job opportunity. In this paper, we examine four accessibility measures, two of which account for spatial competition and the other two do not, using the Los Angeles metropolitan area as a case study. We find that measures of competitive accessibility have stronger associations with employment than non-competitive accessibility measures. We examine the relationship between residential accessibility and employment for four separate levels of educational attainment, and we find that competitive measures are especially pertinent for population segments with lower educational attainment. Therefore, we recommend competitive accessibility measures to assess the employment opportunity more accurately.},

abstract = {As the basic travel service for urban transit, bus services carry the majority of urban passengers. The characterisation of urban residents' transit trips can provide a first-hand reference for the evaluation, management and planning of public transport. Over the past two decades, data from smart cards have become a new source of travel survey data, providing more comprehensive spatial-temporal information about urban public transport trips. In this paper, a multi-step methodology for mining smart card data is developed to analyse the spatial-temporal characteristics of bus travel demand. Using the bus network in Guangzhou, China, as a case study, a smart card dataset is first processed to quantitatively estimate the travel demand at the bus stop level. The term ‘bus service coverage' is introduced to map the bus travel demand from bus stops to regions. This dataset is used to create heat maps that visualise the regional distribution of bus travel demand. To identify the distribution patterns of bus travel demand, two-dimensional principal component analysis and principal component analysis are applied to extract the features of the heat maps, and the Gaussian mixture model is used for the feature clustering. The proposed methodology visually reveals the spatial-temporal patterns of bus travel demand and provides a practical set of visual analytics for transit trip characterisation.},

Although there have been many studies conducted that have measured access levels to public transport stops/stations, there has been limited research on measuring accessibility that integrates population density within geographical areas. This study develops a new measure that considers public transport service frequency and population density as an important distributional indicator. A public transport accessibility index (PTAI) is formulated for quantifying accessibility within local areas in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. A public transport network model is applied to identify the service coverage of public transport modes using a Geographical Information System (GIS). A consistent method is introduced for evaluating public transport accessibility for different levels of analysis, from single elements, including public mode stops to network analysis. The Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel and Activity (VISTA) is used to evaluate the index and examine the association between commuting trips undertaken by public transport and the level of accessibility within the Melbourne metropolitan region. Furthermore, the new index is compared with two existing approaches using the VISTA dataset. Key findings indicate that the PTAI had a stronger association whilst showing more use of public transport in areas with higher values of the PTAI.},

As a result, the distribution of these benefits has received relatively little attention in transportation planning, compared to transport-related burdens. Drawing on philosophies of social justice, we present an equity assessment of the distribution of accessibility in order to define the rate of "access poverty" among the population. We then apply this analysis to regional transportation plan scenarios from the San Francisco Bay Area, focusing on measures of differences between public transit and automobile access. The analysis shows that virtually all neighborhoods suffer from substantial gaps between car and public transport-based accessibility, but that the two proposed transportation investment programs reduce access poverty compared to the "no project" scenario. We also investigate how access and access poverty rates vary by demographic groups and map low-income communities within access impoverished areas, which could be the subject of further focused investments. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Location Based Services (LBS) provide a new perspective for spatiotemporally analyzing dynamic urban systems. Research has investigated urban dynamics using LBS. However, less attention has been paid to the analysis of urban structure (especially commuting pattern) using smart card data (SCD), which are widely available in most large cities in China, and even in the world. This paper combines bus SCD for a one-week period with a oneday household travel survey, as well as a parcel-level land use map to identify job-housing locations and commuting trip routes in Beijing. Two data forms are proposed, one for jobs-housing identification and the other for commuting trip route identification. The results of the identification are aggregated in the bus stop and traffic analysis zone (TAZ) scales, respectively. Particularly, commuting trips from three typical residential communities to six main business zones are mapped and compared to analyze commuting patterns in Beijing. The identified commuting trips are validated by comparison with those from the survey in terms of commuting time and distance, and the positive validation results prove the applicability of our approach. Our experiment, as a first step toward enriching LBS data using conventional survey and urban GIS data, can obtain solid identification results based on rules extracted from existing surveys or censuses.},

abstract = {Access to jobs is an important issue in cities which has not been experienced evenly. The Municipality of S{\~{a}}o Paulo, one of the world's megacities, reflects this uneven accessibility, marked by urban disparities and segregation of poverty-stricken groups. This study examines the inequalities in job accessibility and how it overlaps with socioeconomic indicators, life expectancy and infrastructure conditions, constituting multiple barriers to the most deprived populations. To capture this data, two extreme ends of the human development index have been selected: below the 10th percentile and above the 90th percentile of the Municipal Human Development Index (MHDI). The level of job accessibility was calculated considering proximity to the public transport network. The public transport network was developed in a Geographic Information System (GIS) environment based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) from buses to measure travel times and to compute accessibility. Additionally, a spatial autocorrelation method considering job accessibility and HDI was applied to better explore the spatially overlapped pattern. Results have showed that lower rates of job accessibility are associated with areas of worse socioeconomic condition, where life expectancy is shorter and infrastructure is disproportionally precarious. In addition to facing longer travel times in public transportation, this lowest HDI percentile faces the overlapping inequalities that prevent their social ascension and inclusion. Highlighting these factors is essential in the search for equity in accessibility and the development of more inclusive transport policies.},

Large transportation systems generally have a poor record in systematically integrating innovation in their development, construction and operation. Our research setting is Crossrail, a major new railway traversing London, where the creation and implementation of an innovation strategy formalized and systemized its approach to innovation. Based on in-depth, semi-structured interviews with project leaders and participant observation, the paper critically analyses the formulation, implementation and performance of Crossrail's innovation strategy. Crossrail's management explicitly uses an 'open innovation' strategy that incentivizes partners, contractors, and clients to innovate in the project. Its strategy guides decisions and priorities on innovation and the types and levels of innovation that best match project aims. The paper holds lessons for those developing, operating and studying large transportation systems both now and into the future.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group Recently, it has become common practice for transit operators to provide real-time information (RTI) to passengers about the location or predicted arrival times of transit vehicles. Accompanying this is a growing body of literature that aims to assess the impacts of RTI on transit passenger behaviour and perceptions. The main objective of this research is to compile a literature review of studies that assess the passenger benefits of RTI provision. The results suggest that the primary behavioural changes associated with providing RTI to passengers pertain to decreased wait times, reductions in overall travel time due to changes in path choice, and increased use of transit. RTI may also be associated with increased satisfaction with transit service and increases in the perception of personal security when riding transit. A second objective of this review was to identify areas for future research based on remaining gaps in the literature; two keys areas that were identified are assessing actual behavioural changes of path choice of transit riders and conducting cost–benefit analyses post implementation of RTI systems. The results of this study have immediate implications for public transit operators considering implementation or expansion of RTI systems and researchers seeking topics for future investigation.},

abstract = {Abstract: Automatic data collection (ADC) systems are becoming increasingly common in transit systems throughout the world. Although these ADC systems are often designed to support specific fairly narrow functions, the resulting data can have wide-ranging application, well beyond their design purpose. This article illustrates the potential that ADC systems can provide transit agencies with new rich data sources at low marginal cost, as well as the critical gap between what ADC systems directly offer and what is needed in practice in transit agencies. To close this gap requires data processing and analysis methods with support of technologies such as database management systems (DBMS) and geographic information systems (GIS). This research presents a case study of the automatic fare collection (AFC) system of the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) rail system and develops a method for inferring rail passenger trip origin-destination (OD) matrices from an origin-only AFC system to replace expensive passenger OD surveys. A software tool is developed to facilitate the method implementation and the results of the application in CTA are reported.},

abstract = {Accessibility to jobs by transit is increasingly incorporated into transportation and land-use planning objectives, as it is proven to be a relevant indicator for assessing land-use and transport performance. With a rise in time-sensitive accessibility measures, choosing the appropriate measure is increasingly challenging for engineers, planners and policy-makers. This research presents a comparative analysis of three accessibility measures, two of which are time-sensitive. Relative accessibility measures are generated for five time periods based on a) constant transit service and number of jobs (constant); b) variable transit service and constant number of jobs (static) and c) variable transit service and variable number of jobs available (dynamic). The measures are first assessed by incorporating them into a transit mode share model. Interestingly, findings show that all three measures behaved similarly in the three regression models. Furthermore, all accessibility measures are found to be highly correlated. The study suggests that the most commonly used accessibility measure (constant measure at 8 am) is representative of the relative accessibility (static or dynamic) over the course of the day and is thus appropriate and meaningful to be used by policy-makers, engineers and planners.},

abstract = {This study employs Amartya Sen's Capability Approach as a guiding conceptual framework in the exploration of public transport as an element of mobility among the young-old living in Stockholm, Sweden. The aim is to shed light on the variation in mobility resources of those who perceive they can use public transport as their primary mode of transport and of those who perceive they cannot ('mobility capability element'), as well as that of those using public transport and of those not using it ('mobility functioning element'). Increasing residential density, being female and having a higher functional capacity were among the mobility resources which produced a positive increase in the likelihood of considering it possible to use, and the use of, public transport. The higher the ratio of cars to household member, the lower the likelihood of including public transport as a mobility capability element or as a mobility functioning element. Most of those who included public transport use as both a mobility capability element and a mobility functioning element were also users of the private car. There was also a tendency towards car use rather than towards no travel if the individual was not a user of public transport. Through the application of the Capability Approach, this paper facilitates further insight into the variation in mobility resources, corresponding mobility capability and mobility functioning elements of this group, with respect to public transport. It also opens up questions for the future employment of this conceptual framework within transport research.},

abstract = {As data sources become larger and more complex, the ability to effectively explore and analyze patterns among varying sources becomes a critical bottleneck in analytic reasoning. Incoming data contain multiple variables, high signal-to-noise ratio, and a degree of uncertainty, all of which hinder exploration, hypothesis generation/exploration, and decision making. To facilitate the exploration of such data, advanced tool sets are needed that allow the user to interact with their data in a visual environment that provides direct analytic capability for finding data aberrations or hotspots. In this paper, we present a suite of tools designed to facilitate the exploration of spatiotemporal data sets. Our system allows users to search for hotspots in both space and time, combining linked views and interactive filtering to provide users with contextual information about their data and allow the user to develop and explore their hypotheses. Statistical data models and alert detection algorithms are provided to help draw user attention to critical areas. Demographic filtering can then be further applied as hypotheses generated become fine tuned. This paper demonstrates the use of such tools on multiple geospatiotemporal data sets.},

abstract = {As fare and data collection technology has developed, the resolution of collected data has reached the level of the individual traveler in investigations of transit passenger behavior. This paper investigates the use of these data to estimate passenger origins and destinations at the level of individual stops. Because of a lack of information from the fare collection system, researchers still need some estimate of passengers' alighting stops to complete each passenger trip chain on a specific day. Automated fare collection (AFC) and automated vehicle location (AVL) systems are the inputs to the estimation. Instead of typical AVL data, the paper proposes two models to estimate the alighting stop; both consider passenger trip chaining by using AFC data, transit schedule data (Google's General Transit Feed Specification), and automated passenger counter (APC) data. The paper validates the model by comparing the output to APC data with vehicle location data (APC-VL) and performs sensitivity analyses on several parameters in the models. To detect transfer trips, the new models propose a submodel that takes into account the effect of service headway in addition to some typical transfer time thresholds. Another contribution of this study is the relative relaxation of the search in finding the boarding stops, which enables the alternative algorithm to detect and fix possible errors in identification of the boarding stop for a transaction. As a result, the paper provides algorithms for the proposed models and sensitivity analysis for several predefined scenarios. The results are based on data and observed bus passenger behavior in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, area.},

abstract = {Spatial proportionality plays an important role in recognizing inequities, the quality of actions to reduce them, and halting complicated and unclear cycle of inequities and even reversing their increasing trend. The aim of this study is to measure spatial equity based on spatial proportionalities (SESP), taking into account three-fold factors including service availability, accessibility and mobility. The SESP identifies proportionality between the quality of service distribution and allocating opportunities and the quality of getting access to locations and people's selections according to status quo. Thus, it examines the balance between supply and demand, optimization of distance and the number of choices people make out of total services and the role of move ability to use in compensating for shortages either in terms of service capacity or the level of human deprivation and reduction of effects of distance from services and etc. Gorgan as an old and intermediate city in northern Iran was selected as the case study. The results indicated that the study area does not enjoy suitable proportionality, revealing that the central and northern districts have much more enjoyment than the southern, eastern and western districts. Thus, there is disproportionality between supply and demand, high difference in provided choices and disproportionality between less enjoyed areas and their move ability to use services and inability to create walking travel pattern in Gorgan. Understanding of spatial proportionality can help the planners and policy makers to change their passive role into active in order to reduce inequities, adding to their knowledge on the underlying factors of inequity as well as the factors that hinder and reverse the cycle of inequity.},

abstract = {Accessibility has conventionally been measured and evaluated ignoring user perceptions in favor of focusing on travel time and distance to a number of pre-determined destinations. Acknowledging this gap, we recently developed a scale for perceived accessibility PAC (L{\"{a}}ttman, Friman, {\&} Olsson 2016b) aimed at capturing the individual perspective of accessibility with a certain travel mode. In this paper, we 1) further develop the PAC measure of perceived accessibility in order to capture how easy it is to live a satisfactory life with the help of the transport system, 2) compare levels of perceived accessibility between residential areas and main travel modes, and 3) compare residents' perceived accessibility to the objective accessibility level for the same residential area. Data from 2711 residents of Malm{\"{o}}, Sweden show that perceived accessibility is consistently different from objective accessibility across 13 residential areas, with minor differences in levels of perceived accessibility between areas. Surprisingly, bicycle users rate their accessibility significantly higher than those who mainly use the car or public transport for daily travel, contrary to objective accessibility assumptions. These differences point at the importance of including perceived accessibility as a complementary tool when planning for and evaluating transport systems.},

To this end, the paper includes a discussion of the features of the reform, an explanation of the fields and the contents of the reform, and an assessment of the performance of the reform formulated by comparing pertinent circumstances in place before and after its inception. The performance of eight fields: bus routes, bus fares, bus management, bus operation, a new smart card, a median bus lane system, vehicles and stops, and the promotion of the BTR, are measured, as are the performances of four groups influenced by the BTR. Those groups are bus passengers, bus operators, transport regulators, and members of the wider civil community. The results indicate a readily apparent decrease in traffic density in Seoul after the introduction of the reform, and it would appear that the increase in the number of public transport users bears an inverse relationship with the decrease in the transport share of private cars. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Accessibility is a key indicator for the number of opportunities experienced by an individual, and it is generally assumed that higher levels of accessibility lead to higher levels of activity participation and satisfaction. Despite the fact that this relationship has been tested in preceding studies, no clear pattern of correlation has been found between an individual's accessibility and his/her participation in out-of-home discretionary activities. Previous studies mostly applied aggregate, spatial accessibility measures that do not account for the heterogeneity related to an individual's spatio-temporal constraints. However, in addition to locations' spatial distribution, personal constraints related to the mandatory activities a person undertakes – and therefore, his/her available time budget throughout the day – impact activity choices and scheduling. This paper proposes a disaggregate, person-based accessibility measure that takes spatial and temporal constraints into consideration for the travel behavior of 11,599 individuals in the Wasatch Front region, Utah. This method is compared to an aggregate, home-based accessibility measure to assess both methods' ability to predict activity participation. The results show a highly significant, moderate correlation between the proposed person-based accessibility measure and participants' surveyed partaking in discretionary activities. Both the model prediction and the locally weighted regression smoother indicate that the greatest change in participation occurs within the mid-range of accessibility levels, and not in the low end of the accessibility range as was expected. In addition, the home-based method shows a negative and highly significant relationship to activity participation, which indicates that aggregate accessibility measures may provide counterintuitive findings.},

These data are appealing for research because they are frequently collected and quickly released; they cover a wide variety of attitudes, lifestyles and behavioural characteristics; and they are often dynamically replenished and longitudinal. It is demonstrated that consumer data can make important contributions to understanding problems in transport geography and in solving applied problems ranging from migration, infrastructure investment and retail service provision to commuting and individual mobility. However more effective exploitation of these data depends on the construction of bridges to allow greater freedom in the transfer of data from the commercial to the academic sector; it requires development of frameworks for privacy and ethics in the secondary use of personal data; and it is contingent on the emergence of effective strategies for the amelioration of selection bias which impairs the quality of many consumer data sources.},

Without any prior assumption, this paper openly explores spatial disparities of accessibility in the city of Atlanta, USA using both the UberX (the most popular Uber product) and the UberBLACK (the premium Uber product) data. Accessibility is measured by both the expectation and variability of Uber wait time. With spatial autoregressive models, we find that after controlling for other socioeconomic factors, wealth and race do not have significant associations with Uber accessibility. Additionally, higher road network density, population density, and less commuting time to work correlate with greater Uber accessibility. More public transport stops are related to better accessibility of UberX but worse accessibility of UberBLACK. Finally, implications for policy-makers are provided.},

While their main purpose is to collect revenue, they also produce large quantities of very detailed data on onboard transactions. These data can be very useful to transit planners, from the day-to-day operation of the transit system to the strategic long-term planning of the network. This review covers several aspects of smart card data use in the public transit context. First, the technologies are presented: the hardware and information systems required to operate these tools; and privacy concerns and legal issues related to the dissemination of smart card data, data storage, and encryption are addressed. Then, the various uses of the data at three levels of management are described: strategic (long-term planning), tactical (service adjustments and network development), and operational (ridership statistics and performance indicators). Also reported are smart card commercialization experiments conducted all over the world. Finally, the most promising research avenues for smart card data in this field are presented; for example, comparison of planned and implemented schedules, systematic schedule adjustments, and the survival models applied to ridership. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A model for estimating the trip purpose is derived from the person trip survey data. By using the model, trip purposes are estimated as supplementary behavioural attributes of the trips observed in the smart card data. The validation analysis showed that the proposed method successfully estimated the trip purposes in 86.2{\%} of the validation data. The empirical data mining analysis showed that the proposed methodology can be applied to find and interpret the behavioural features observed in the smart card data which had been difficult to obtain from each independent dataset. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Often, of interest is to estimate the unknown position of the object at unrecorded time points to increase the temporal resolution of the data, to correct erroneous or missing data points, or to match the recorded times between multiple data sets. Estimating an object's unknown location between known locations is termed path interpolation. This paper introduces a new method for path interpolation termed kinematic interpolation. Kinematic interpolation incorporates object kinematics (i.e. velocity and acceleration) into the interpolation process. Six empirical data sets (two types of correlated random walks, caribou, cyclist, hurricane and athlete tracking data) are used to compare kinematic interpolation to other interpolation algorithms. Results showed kinematic interpolation to be a suitable interpolation method with fast-moving objects (e.g. the cyclist, hurricane and athlete tracking data), while other algorithms performed best with the correlated random walk and caribou data. Several issues associated with path interpolation tasks are discussed along with potential applications where kinematic interpolation can be useful. Finally, code for performing path interpolation is provided (for each method compared within) using the statistical software R.},

abstract = {Transit accessibility is a key determinant in explaining transit use and promoting transit policies. The improvement of transit access conditions is deemed to improve the overall quality of the transit service, the user experience, and ultimately, the transit ridership. In transport modeling, however, transit accessibility is still modeled in a very crude manner based on centroid connectors. This approach does not render actual walking conditions as encountered by transit users. The current paper proposes a new definition of transit access for transport modeling purposes. In contrast to current practice which is based on centroid connectors, this new definition uses high resolution spatial data to model actual access and egress conditions to and from transit facilities. The new approach relies on the spatial distribution of potential transit users and their probability of using transit facilities. Two automatic methods have been developed: selection of accessible transit facilities on the basis of their proximity and computation of the length of connectors using distance decay functions. Results from the urban area of Lyon, France, show the significant contribution of the new definition. In comparison to the standard method, the new definition is found to improve main transit modeling outcomes and to better reproduce observed data. This new method can assist transport planners and public authorities to evaluate transit policies more accurately and instruct more appropriately policy makers.},

abstract = {The public transport networks of dense cities such as London serve passengers with widely different travel patterns. In line with the diverse lives of urban dwellers, activities and journeys are combined within days and across days in diverse sequences. From personalized customer information, to improved travel demand models, understanding this type of heterogeneity among transit users is relevant to a number of applications core to public transport agencies' function. In this study, passenger heterogeneity is investigated based on a longitudinal representation of each user's multi-week activity sequence derived from smart card data. We propose a methodology leveraging this representation to identify clusters of users with similar activity sequence structure. The methodology is applied to a large sample (n = 33,026) from London's public transport network, in which each passenger is represented by a continuous 4-week activity sequence. The application reveals 11 clusters, each characterized by a distinct sequence structure. Socio-demographic information available for a small sample of users (n = 1973) is combined to smart card transactions to analyze associations between the identified patterns and demographic attributes including passenger age, occupation, household composition and income, and vehicle ownership. The analysis reveals that significant connections exist between the demographic attributes of users and activity patterns identified exclusively from fare transactions.},

abstract = {Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) is being implemented as a neoliberal project, but it creates contradictions that challenge the premise of neoliberalism. BRT projects are affordable rapid transit infrastructure, but they are also an impetus to restructure the urban bus sector in developing cities with informal mass transport. The dominant model of BRT implementation creates a market for bus service from large private companies where the government takes on the risk and brands the service as part of the city's attempt to be a 'world class' city that can attract mobile capital. However, BRT and the formalization of the bus sector can increase the power of urban residents by firmly putting transport in the public sphere; workers by increasing the incentives for collective action; and bus riders by prioritizing space for buses over cars. But these are only openings that require action to take advantage of the contradictions.},

abstract = {Development of an origin-destination demand matrix is crucial for transit planning. The development process is facilitated by automated transit smart card data, making it possible to mine boarding and alighting patterns on an individual basis. This research proposes a novel trip chaining method which uses Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data to infer the most likely trajectory of individual transit passengers. The method relaxes the assumptions on various parameters used in the existing trip chaining algorithms such as transfer walking distance threshold, buffer distance for selecting the boarding location, time window for selecting the vehicle trip, etc. The method also resolves issues related to errors in GPS location recorded by AFC systems or selection of incorrect sub-route from GTFS data. The proposed trip chaining method generates a set of candidate trajectories for each AFC tag to reach the next tag, calculates the probability of each trajectory, and selects the most likely trajectory to infer the boarding and alighting stops. The method is applied to transit data from the Twin Cities, MN, which has an open transit system where passengers tap smart cards only once when boarding (or when alighting on pay-exit buses). Based on the consecutive tags of the passenger, the proposed algorithm is also modified for pay-exit cases. The method is compared to previous methods developed by the researchers and shows improvement in the number of inferred cases. Finally, results are visualized to understand the route ridership and geographical pattern of trips.},

abstract = {Urban transport policies are characterized by a wide range of impacts, and trade-offs and conflicts among these impacts. The task of integrating and reconciling these impacts poses challenges, because they are incommensurable, and they affect different groups differentially. Further, impacts such as those related to social equity are hard to define and measure. In this paper we address two inter-related questions: How is social equity conceptualized, operationalized, and prioritized relative to environmental and other objectives; and how might social equity be more effectively integrated in urban transportation plans in North America? We critically analyze how social equity is incorporated into transportation plans in 18 large North American metropolitan areas, in terms of the quality of the related objectives, how meaningfully their achievement is assessed through the choice of performance measures or indicators, and their prioritization relative to other objectives. We observe that social equity goals and objectives are in many cases not translated into clearly specified objectives, and appropriate measures for assessing their achievement in a meaningful, disaggregated manner are often lacking. At the same time, there are good examples of social equity objectives and measures in several plans. In general, there is a stronger focus on the local environment (and congestion reduction) than on social equity in the plans. We end the paper with a discussion related to considerations for generating objectives and measures for better integrating social equity into urban transportation plans.},
